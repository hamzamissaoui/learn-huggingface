    "text": "1 Overview\nWelcome to the Learn Hugging Face Text Classificaiton project!\nThis tutorial is hands-on and focused on writing resuable code.\nWe’ll start with a text dataset, build a model to classify text samples and then share our model as a demo others can use.\nTo do so, we’ll be using a handful of helpful open-source tools from the Hugging Face ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\nWe’re going to put on our internship hats and build a food not food text classification model using tools from the Hugging Face ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFeel to keep reading through the notebook but if you’d like to run the code yourself, be sure to go through the setup guide first.\n\n\n\n1.1 What we’re going to build\nWe’re going to be bulding a food/not_food text classification model.\nGiven a piece of a text (such as an image caption), our model will be able to predict if it’s about food or not.\nThis is the same kind of model I use in my own work on Nutrify (an app to help people learn about food).\nMore specifically, we’re going to follow the following steps:\n\nData: Problem defintion and dataset preparation - Getting a dataset/setting up the problem space.\nModel: Finding, training and evaluating a model - Finding a text classification model suitable for our problem on Hugging Face and customizing it to our own dataset.\nDemo: Creating a demo and put our model into the real world - Sharing our trained model in a way others can access and use.\n\nBy the end of this project, you’ll have a trained model and demo on Hugging Face you can share with others:\n\nfrom IPython.display import HTML \n\nHTML(\"\"\"\n&lt;iframe\n    src=\"https://mrdbourke-learn-hf-food-not-food-text-classifier-demo.hf.space\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n    width=\"850\"\n    height=\"650\"\n&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\"\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote this is a hands-on project, so we’ll be focused on writing reusable code and building a model that can be used in the real world. If you are looking for explainers to the theory of what we’re doing, I’ll leave links in the extra-curriculum section.\n\n\n\n\n1.2 What is text classification?\nText classification is the process of assigning a category to a piece of text.\nWhere a category can be almost anything and a piece of text can be a word, phrase, sentence, paragraph or entire document.\nExample text classification problems include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\nDescription\nProblem Type\n\n\n\n\nSpam/phishing email detection\nIs an email spam or not spam? Or is it a phishing email or not?\nBinary classification (one thing or another)\n\n\nSentiment analysis\nIs a piece of text positive, negative or neutral? Such as classifying product reviews into good/bad/neutral.\nMulti-class classification (one thing from many)\n\n\nLanguage detection\nWhat language is a piece of text written in?\nMulti-class classification (one thing from many)\n\n\nTopic classification\nWhat topic(s) does a news article belong to?\nMulti-label classification (one or more things from many)\n\n\nHate speech detection\nIs a comment hateful or not hateful?\nBinary classification (one thing or another)\n\n\nProduct categorization\nWhat categories does a product belong to?\nMulti-label classification (one or more things from many)\n\n\nBusiness email classification\nWhich category should this email go to?\nMulti-class classification (one thing from many)\n\n\n\nText classification is a very common problem in many business settings.\nFor example, a project I’ve worked on previously as a machine learning engineer was building a text classification model to classify different insurance claims into claimant_at_fault/claimant_not_at_fault for a large insurance company.\nIt turns out the deep learning-based model we built was very good (98%+ accuracy on the test dataset).\n\n\n\n\nAn example text classification problem I once worked on to classify insurance claim texts into at fault or not fault. This result of the model would send the claim to a different department in the insurance company.\n\n\nSpeaking of models, there are several different kinds of models you can use for text classification.\nAnd each will have its pros and cons depending on the problem you’re working on.\nExample text classification models include:\n\n\n\nModel\nDescription\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nRule-based\nUses a set of rules to classify text (e.g. if text contains “sad” -&gt; sentiment = low)\nSimple, easy to understand\nRequires manual creation of rules\n\n\nBag of Words\nCounts the frequency of words in a piece of text\nSimple, easy to understand\nDoesn’t capture word order\n\n\nTF-IDF\nWeighs the importance of words in a piece of text\nSimple, easy to understand\nDoesn’t capture word order\n\n\nDeep learning-based models\nUses neural networks to learn patterns in text\nCan learn complex patterns at scale\nCan require large amounts of data/compute power to run, not as easy to understand (can be hard to debug)\n\n\n\nFor our project, we’re going to go with a deep learning model.\nWhy?\nBecause Hugging Face helps us do so.\nAnd in most cases, with a quality dataset, a deep learning model will often perform better than a rule-based or other model.\n\n\n1.3 Why train your own text classification models?\nYou can customize pre-trained models for text classification as well as API-powered models and LLMs such as GPT, Gemini, Claude or Mistral.\nDepending on your requirements, there are several pros and cons for using your own model versus using an API.\nTraining/fine-tuning your own model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nControl: Full control over model lifecycle.\nCan be complex to get setup.\n\n\nNo usage limits (aside from compute constraints).\nRequires dedicated compute resources for training/inference.\n\n\nCan train once and deploy everywhere/whenever you want (for example, Tesla deploying a model to all self-driving cars).\nRequires maintenance over time to ensure performance remains up to par.\n\n\nPrivacy: Data can be kept in-house/app and doesn’t need to go to a third party.\nCan require longer development cycles compared to using existing APIs.\n\n\nSpeed: Customizing a small model for a specific use case often means it runs much faster.\n\n\n\n\nUsing a pre-built model API (e.g. GPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nEase of use: often can be setup within a few lines of code.\nIf the model API goes down, your service goes down.\n\n\nNo maintenance of compute resources.\nData is required to be sent to a third-party for processing.\n\n\nAccess to the most advanced models.\nThe API may have usage limits per day/time period.\n\n\nCan scale if usage increases.\nCan be much slower than using dedicated models due to requiring an API call.\n\n\n\nFor this project, we’re going to focus on fine-tuning our own model.\n\n\n1.4 Workflow we’re going to follow\nOur motto is data, model, demo!\nSo we’re going to follow the rough workflow of:\n\nCreate and preprocess data.\nDefine the model we’d like use with transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification (or another similar model class).\nDefine training arguments (these are hyperparameters for our model) with transformers.TrainingArguments.\nPass TrainingArguments from 3 and target datasets to an instance of transformers.Trainer.\nTrain the model by calling Trainer.train().\nSave the model (to our local machine or to the Hugging Face Hub).\nEvaluate the trained model by making and inspecting predctions on the test data.\nTurn the model into a shareable demo.\n\nI say rough because machine learning projects are often non-linear in nature.\nAs in, because machine learning projects involve many experiments, they can kind of be all over the place.\nBut this worfklow will give us some good guidelines to follow.\n\n\n\n\nA general Hugging Face workflow from idea to shared model and demo using tools from the Hugging Face ecosystem. You’ll notice some of the steps don’t match with our workflow outline above. This is because the text-based workflow outline above breaks some of the steps down for educational purposes. These kind of workflows are not set in stone and are more of guide than specific directions. See information on each of the tools in the Hugging Face documentation.",

    "text": "3 Getting a dataset\nOkay, now we’re got the required libraries, let’s get a dataset.\nGetting a dataset is one of the most important things a machine learning project.\nThe dataset you often determines the type of model you use as well as the quality of the outputs of that model.\nMeaning, if you have a high quality dataset, chances are, your future model could also have high quality outputs.\nIt also means if your dataset is of poor quality, your model will likely also have poor quality outputs.\nFor a text classificaiton problem, your dataset will likely come in the form of text (e.g. a paragraph, sentence or phrase) and a label (e.g. what category the text belongs to).\n\n\n\n\nOur  food not food image caption dataset on the Hugging Face Hub.\n\n\nIn our case, our dataset comes in the form of a collection of synthetic image captions and their corresponding labels (food or not food).\nThis is a dataset I’ve created earlier to help us practice building a text classification model.\nYou can find it on Hugging Face under the name mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_image_captions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Not Food Image Caption Dataset Creation\n\n\n\nYou can see how the Food Not Food image caption dataset was created in the example Google Colab notebook.\nA Large Language Model (LLM) was asked to generate various image caption texts about food and not food.\nGetting another model to create data for a problem is known as synthetic data generation and is a very good way of bootstrapping towards creating a model.\nOne workflow would be to use real data wherever possible and use synthetic data to boost when needed.\nNote that it’s always advised to evaluate/test models on real-life data as opposed to synthetic data.\n\n\n\n3.1 Where can you get more datasets?\nThe are many different places you can get datasets for text-based problems.\nOne of the best places is on the Hugging Face Hub, specifically huggingface.co/datasets.\nHere you can find many different kinds of problem specific data such as text classification.\nThere are also many more datasets available on Kaggle Datasets.\nAnd thanks to the power of LLMs (Large Language Models), you can also now create your own text classifications by generating samples (this is how I created the dataset for this project).\n\n\n\n\nHugging Face Datasets and Kaggle Datasets are two of the best places on the internet to find all kinds of different datasets. If you can’t find an existing dataset related to your problem you can either use your own data or potentially generate synthetic data samples with an LLM. For more on synthetic data generation, see the Creating Synthetic Data article by NVIDIA.\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Loading the dataset\nOnce we’ve found/prepared a dataset on the Hugging Face Hub, we can use the Hugging Face datasets library to load it.\nTo load a dataset we can use the datasets.load_dataset(path=NAME_OR_PATH_OF_DATASET) function and pass it the name/path of the dataset we want to load.\nIn our case, our dataset name is mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_image_captions (you can also change this for your own dataset).\nAnd since our dataset is hosted on Hugging Face, when we run the following code for the first time, it will download it.\nIf your target dataset is quite large, this download may take a while.\nHowever, once the dataset is downloaded, subsequent reloads will be mush faster.\n\n# Load the dataset from Hugging Face Hub\ndataset = datasets.load_dataset(path=\"mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_image_captions\")\n\n# Inspect the dataset\ndataset\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['text', 'label'],\n        num_rows: 250\n    })\n})\n\n\nDataset loaded!\nLooks like our dataset has two features, text and label.\nAnd 250 total rows (the number of examples in our dataset).\nWe can check the column names with dataset.column_names.\n\n# What features are there?\ndataset.column_names\n\n{'train': ['text', 'label']}\n\n\nLooks like our dataset comes with a train split already (the whole dataset).\nWe can access the train split with dataset[\"train\"] (some datasets also come with built-in \"test\" splits too).\n\n# Access the training split\ndataset[\"train\"]\n\nDataset({\n    features: ['text', 'label'],\n    num_rows: 250\n})\n\n\nHow about we check out a single sample?\nWe can do so with indexing.\n\ndataset[\"train\"][0]\n\n{'text': 'Creamy cauliflower curry with garlic naan, featuring tender cauliflower in a rich sauce with cream and spices, served with garlic naan bread.',\n 'label': 'food'}\n\n\nNice! We get back a dictionary with the keys text and label.\nThe text key contains the text of the image caption and the label key contains the label (food or not food).\n\n\n3.3 Inspect random examples from the dataset\nAt 250 total samples, our dataset isn’t too large.\nSo we could sit here and explore the samples one by one.\nBut whenever I interact with a new dataset, I like to view a bunch of random examples and get a feel of the data.\nDoing so is inline with the data explorer’s motto: visualize, visualize, visualize!\nAs a rule of thumb, I like to view at least 20-100 random examples when interacting with a new dataset.\nLet’s write some code to view 5 random indexes of our data and their corresponding text and labels at a time.\n\nimport random\n\nrandom_indexs = random.sample(range(len(dataset[\"train\"])), 5)\nrandom_samples = dataset[\"train\"][random_indexs]\n\nprint(f\"[INFO] Random samples from dataset:\\n\")\nfor item in zip(random_samples[\"text\"], random_samples[\"label\"]):\n    print(f\"Text: {item[0]} | Label: {item[1]}\")\n\n[INFO] Random samples from dataset:\n\nText: Set of spatulas kept in a holder | Label: not_food\nText: Mouthwatering paneer tikka masala, featuring juicy paneer in a rich tomato-based sauce, garnished with fresh coriander leaves. | Label: food\nText: Pair of reading glasses left open on a book | Label: not_food\nText: Set of board games stacked on a shelf | Label: not_food\nText: Two handfuls of bananas in a fruit bowl with grapes on the side, the fruit bowl is blue | Label: food\n\n\nBeautiful! Looks like our data contains a mix of shorter and longer sentences (between 5 and 20 words) of texts about food and not food.\nWe can get the unique labels in our dataset with dataset[\"train\"].unique(\"label\").\n\n# Get unique label values\ndataset[\"train\"].unique(\"label\")\n\n['food', 'not_food']\n\n\nIf our dataset is small enough to fit into memory, we can count the number of different labels with Python’s collections.Counter (a method for counting objects in an iterable or mapping).\n\n# Check number of each label\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nCounter(dataset[\"train\"][\"label\"])\n\nCounter({'food': 125, 'not_food': 125})\n\n\nExcellent, looks like our dataset is well balanced with 125 samples of food and 125 samples of not food.\nIn a binary classification case, this is ideal.\nIf the classes were dramatically unbalanced (e.g. 90% food and 10% not food) we might have to consider collecting/creating more data.\nBut best to train a model and see how it goes before making any drastic dataset changes.\nBecause our dataset is small, we could also inspect it via a pandas DataFrame (however, this may not be possible for extremely large datasets).\n\n# Turn our dataset into a DataFrame and get a random sample\nfood_not_food_df = pd.DataFrame(dataset[\"train\"])\nfood_not_food_df.sample(7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntext\nlabel\n\n\n\n\n142\nA slice of pizza with a generous amount of shr...\nfood\n\n\n6\nPair of reading glasses left open on a book\nnot_food\n\n\n97\nTelescope positioned on a balcony\nnot_food\n\n\n60\nA close-up of a family playing a board game wi...\nnot_food\n\n\n112\nRich and spicy lamb rogan josh with yogurt gar...\nfood\n\n\n181\nA steaming bowl of fiery chicken curry, infuse...\nfood\n\n\n197\nPizza with a stuffed crust, oozing with cheese\nfood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Get the value counts of the label column\nfood_not_food_df[\"label\"].value_counts()\n\nlabel\nfood        125\nnot_food    125\nName: count, dtype: int64",

    "text": "4 Preparing data for text classification\nWe’ve got our data ready but there are a few steps we’ll need to take before we can model it.\nThe main two being:\n\nTokenization - turning our text into a numerical representation (machines prefer numbers rather than words), for example, {\"a\": 0, \"b\": 1, \"c\": 2...}.\nCreating a train/test split - right now our data is in a training split only but we’ll create a test set to evaluate our model’s performance.\n\nThese don’t necessarily have to be in order either.\nBefore we get to them, let’s create a small mapping from our labels to numbers.\nIn the same way we need to tokenize our text into numerical representation, we also need to do the same for our labels.\n\n4.1 Creating a mapping from labels to numbers\nOur machine learning model will want to see all numbers (people do well with text, computers do well with numbers).\nThis goes for text as well as label input.\nSo let’s create a mapping from our labels to numbers.\nSince we’ve only got a couple of labels (\"food\" and \"not_food\"), we can create a dictionary to map them to numbers, however, if you’ve got a fair few labels, you may want to make this mapping programmatically.\nWe can use these dictionaries later on for our model training as well as evaluation.\n\n# Create mapping from id2label and label2id\nid2label = {0: \"not_food\", 1: \"food\"}\nlabel2id = {\"not_food\": 0, \"food\": 1}\n\nprint(f\"Label to ID mapping: {label2id}\")\nprint(f\"ID to Label mapping: {id2label}\")\n\nLabel to ID mapping: {'not_food': 0, 'food': 1}\nID to Label mapping: {0: 'not_food', 1: 'food'}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn a binary classification task (such as what we’re working on), the positive class, in our case \"food\", is usually given the label 1 and the negative class (\"not_food\") is given the label 0.\n\n\nRather than hard-coding our label to ID maps, we can also create them programmatically from the dataset (this is helpful if you have many classes).\n\n# Create mappings programmatically from dataset\nid2label = {idx: label for idx, label in enumerate(dataset[\"train\"].unique(\"label\")[::-1])} # reverse sort list to have \"not_food\" first\nlabel2id = {label: idx for idx, label in id2label.items()}\n\nprint(f\"Label to ID mapping: {label2id}\")\nprint(f\"ID to Label mapping: {id2label}\")\n\nLabel to ID mapping: {'not_food': 0, 'food': 1}\nID to Label mapping: {0: 'not_food', 1: 'food'}\n\n\nWith our dictionary mappings created, we can update the labels of our dataset to be numeric.\nWe can do this using the datasets.Dataset.map method and passing it a function to apply to each example.\nLet’s create a small function which turns an example label into a number.\n\n# Turn labels into 0 or 1 (e.g. 0 for \"not_food\", 1 for \"food\")\ndef map_labels_to_number(example):\n  example[\"label\"] = label2id[example[\"label\"]]\n  return example\n\nexample_sample = {\"text\": \"This is a sentence about my favourite food: honey.\", \"label\": \"food\"}\n\n# Test the function\nmap_labels_to_number(example_sample)\n\n{'text': 'This is a sentence about my favourite food: honey.', 'label': 1}\n\n\nLooks like our function works!\nHow about we map it to the whole dataset?\n\n# Map our dataset labels to numbers\ndataset = dataset[\"train\"].map(map_labels_to_number)\ndataset[:5]\n\n{'text': ['Creamy cauliflower curry with garlic naan, featuring tender cauliflower in a rich sauce with cream and spices, served with garlic naan bread.',\n  'Set of books stacked on a desk',\n  'Watching TV together, a family has their dog stretched out on the floor',\n  'Wooden dresser with a mirror reflecting the room',\n  'Lawn mower stored in a shed'],\n 'label': [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n\n\nNice! Looks like our labels are all numerical now.\nWe can check a few random samples using dataset.shuffle() and indexing for the first few.\n\n# Shuffle the dataset and view the first 5 samples (will return different results each time) \ndataset.shuffle()[:5]\n\n{'text': ['Set of oven mitts hanging on a hook',\n  'Set of cookie cutters collected in a jar',\n  'Pizza with a dessert twist, featuring a sweet Nutella base and fresh strawberries on top',\n  'Set of binoculars placed on a table',\n  'Two handfuls of bananas in a fruit bowl with grapes on the side, the fruit bowl is blue'],\n 'label': [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Split the dataset into training and test sets\nRight now our dataset only has a training split.\nHowever, we’d like to create a test split so we can evaluate our model.\nIn essence, our model will learn patterns (the relationship between text captions and their labels of food/not_food) on the training data.\nAnd we will evaluate those learned patterns on the test data.\nWe can split our data using the datasets.Dataset.train_test_split method.\nWe can use the test_size parameter to define the percentage of data we’d like to use in our test set (e.g. test_size=0.2 would mean 20% of the data goes to the test set).\n\n# Create train/test splits\ndataset = dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.2, seed=42) # note: seed isn't needed, just here for reproducibility, without it you will get different splits each time you run the cell\ndataset\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['text', 'label'],\n        num_rows: 200\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['text', 'label'],\n        num_rows: 50\n    })\n})\n\n\nPerfect!\nOur dataset has been split into 200 training examples and 50 testing examples.\nLet’s visualize a few random examples to make sure they still look okay.\n\nrandom_idx_train = random.randint(0, len(dataset[\"train\"]))\nrandom_sample_train = dataset[\"train\"][random_idx_train]\n\nrandom_idx_test = random.randint(0, len(dataset[\"test\"]))\nrandom_sample_test = dataset[\"test\"][random_idx_test]\n\nprint(f\"[INFO] Random sample from training dataset:\")\nprint(f\"Text: {random_sample_train['text']}\\nLabel: {random_sample_train['label']} ({id2label[random_sample_train['label']]})\\n\")\nprint(f\"[INFO] Random sample from testing dataset:\")\nprint(f\"Text: {random_sample_test['text']}\\nLabel: {random_sample_test['label']} ({id2label[random_sample_test['label']]})\")\n\n[INFO] Random sample from training dataset:\nText: Set of dumbbells stacked in a gym\nLabel: 0 (not_food)\n\n[INFO] Random sample from testing dataset:\nText: Two handfuls of bananas in a fruit bowl with grapes on the side, the fruit bowl is blue\nLabel: 1 (food)\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Tokenizing text data\nLabels numericalized, dataset split, time to turn our text into numbers.\nHow?\nTokenization.\nWhat’s tokenization?\nTokenization is the process of converting a non-numerical data source into numbers.\nWhy?\nBecause machines (especially machine learning models) prefer numbers to human-style data.\nIn the case of the text \"I love pizza\" a very simple method of tokenization might be to convert each word to a number.\nFor example, {\"I\": 0, \"love\": 1, \"pizza\": 2}.\nHowever, for most modern machine learning models, the tokenization process is a bit more nuanced.\nFor example, the text \"I love pizza\" might be tokenized into something more like [101, 1045, 2293, 10733, 102].\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it may seem like you can type text directly to machine learning models, behind the scenes they are converting it to numbers first. This happens for all kinds of data being passed to machine learning models. It goes from its raw form (e.g. text, image, audio) and gets turned into a numerical representation (often called tokenization) before it is processed by the model. Exactly how data gets turned into numbers will often be different depending on the model. This example shows the use of OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 & GPT-4 tokenizer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDepending on the model you use, the tokenization process could be different.\nFor example, one model might turn \"I love pizza\" into [40, 3021, 23317], where as another model might turn it into [101, 1045, 2293, 10733, 102].\nTo deal with this, Hugging Face models often pair models and tokenizers together by name.\nSuch is the case with distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased (there is a tokenizer.json file as well as a tokenizer_config.json file which contains all of the tokenizer implementation details).\nFor more examples of tokenization, you can see OpenAI’s tokenization visualizer tool as well as their open-source library tiktoken, Google also have an open-source tokenization library called sentencepiece, finally Hugging Face’s tokenizers library is also a great resource (this is what we’ll be using behind the scenes).\n\n\nMany of the text-based models on Hugging Face come paired with their own tokenizer.\nFor example, the distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased model is paired with the distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased tokenizer.\nWe can load the tokenizer for a given model using the transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained method and passing it the name of the model we’d like to use.\nThe transformers.AutoTokenizer class is part of a series of Auto Classes (such as AutoConfig, AutoModel, AutoProcessor) which automatically loads the correct configuration settings for a given model ID.\nLet’s load the tokenizer for the distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased model and see how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy use the distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased model?\nThe short answer is that I’ve used it before and it works well (and fast) on various text classification tasks.\nIt also performed well in the original research paper which introduced it.\nThe longer answer is that Hugging Face has many available open-source models for many different problems available at https://huggingface.co/models.\nNavigating these models can take some practice.\nAnd several models may be suited for the same task (though with various tradeoffs such as size and speed).\nHowever, overtime and with adequate experimentation, you’ll start to build an intuition on which models are good for which problems.\n\n\n\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_name_or_path=\"distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased\",\n                                          use_fast=True) # uses fast tokenization (backed by tokenziers library and implemented in Rust) by default, if not available will default to Python implementation\n\ntokenizer\n\nDistilBertTokenizerFast(name_or_path='distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased', vocab_size=30522, model_max_length=512, is_fast=True, padding_side='right', truncation_side='right', special_tokens={'unk_token': '[UNK]', 'sep_token': '[SEP]', 'pad_token': '[PAD]', 'cls_token': '[CLS]', 'mask_token': '[MASK]'}, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True),  added_tokens_decoder={\n    0: AddedToken(\"[PAD]\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=False, special=True),\n    100: AddedToken(\"[UNK]\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=False, special=True),\n    101: AddedToken(\"[CLS]\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=False, special=True),\n    102: AddedToken(\"[SEP]\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=False, special=True),\n    103: AddedToken(\"[MASK]\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=False, special=True),\n}\n\n\nNice!\nThere’s our tokenizer!\nIt’s an instance of the transformers.DistilBertTokenizerFast class.\nYou can read more about it in the documentation.\nFor now, let’s try it out by passing it a string of text.\n\n# Test out tokenizer\ntokenizer(\"I love pizza\")\n\n{'input_ids': [101, 1045, 2293, 10733, 102], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\n\n\n# Try adding a \"!\" at the end\ntokenizer(\"I love pizza!\")\n\n{'input_ids': [101, 1045, 2293, 10733, 999, 102], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\n\nWoohoo!\nOur text gets turned into numbers (or tokens).\nNotice how with even a slight change in the text, the tokenizer produces different results?\nThe input_ids are our tokens.\nAnd the attention_mask (in our case, all [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) is a mask which tells the model which tokens to use or not.\nTokens with a mask value of 1 get used and tokens with a mask value of 0 get ignored.\nThere are several attributes of the tokenizer we can explore.\n\ntokenizer.vocab will return the vocabulary of the tokenizer or in other words, the unique words/word pieces the tokenizer is capable of converting into numbers.\ntokenizer.model_max_length will return the maximum length of a sequence the tokenizer can process, pass anything longer than this and the sequence will be truncated.\n\n\n# Get the length of the vocabulary \nlength_of_tokenizer_vocab = len(tokenizer.vocab)\nprint(f\"Length of tokenizer vocabulary: {length_of_tokenizer_vocab}\")\n\n# Get the maximum sequence length the tokenizer can handle\nmax_tokenizer_input_sequence_length = tokenizer.model_max_length\nprint(f\"Max tokenizer input sequence length: {max_tokenizer_input_sequence_length}\")\n\nLength of tokenizer vocabulary: 30522\nMax tokenizer input sequence length: 512\n\n\nWoah, looks like our tokenizer has a vocabulary of 30,522 different words and word pieces.\nAnd it can handle a sequence length of up to 512 (any sequence longer than this will be automatically truncated from the end).\nLet’s check out some of the vocab.\nCan I find my own name?\n\n# Does \"daniel\" occur in the vocab?\ntokenizer.vocab[\"daniel\"]\n\n3817\n\n\nOooh, looks like my name is 3817 in the tokenizer’s vocab.\nCan you find your own name? (note: there may be an error if the token doesn’t exist, we’ll get to this)\nHow about “pizza”?\n\ntokenizer.vocab[\"pizza\"]\n\n10733\n\n\nWhat if a word doesn’t exist in the vocab?\n\ntokenizer.vocab[\"akash\"]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[26], line 1\n----&gt; 1 tokenizer.vocab[\"akash\"]\n\nKeyError: 'akash'\n\n\n\nDam, we get a KeyError.\nNot to worry, this is okay, since when calling the tokenizer on the word, it will automatically split the word into word pieces or subwords.\n\ntokenizer(\"akash\")\n\n{'input_ids': [101, 9875, 4095, 102], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\n\nIt works!\nWe can check what word pieces \"akash\" got broken into with tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids).\n\ntokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(tokenizer(\"akash\").input_ids)\n\n['[CLS]', 'aka', '##sh', '[SEP]']\n\n\nAhhh, it seems \"akash\" was split into two tokens, [\"aka\", \"##sh\"].\nThe \"##\" at the start of \"##sh\" means that the sequence is part of a larger sequence.\nAnd the \"[CLS]\" and \"[SEP]\" tokens are special tokens indicating the start and end of a sequence.\nNow, since tokenizers can deal with any text, what if there was an unknown token?\nFor example, rather than \"pizza\" someone used the pizza emoji 🍕?\nLet’s try!\n\n# Try to tokenize an emoji\ntokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(tokenizer(\"🍕\").input_ids)\n\n['[CLS]', '[UNK]', '[SEP]']\n\n\nAhh, we get the special \"[UNK]\" token.\nThis stands for “unknown”.\nThe combination of word pieces and \"[UNK]\" special token means that our tokenizer will be able to turn almost any text into numbers for our model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that just because one tokenizer uses an unknown special token for a particular word or emoji (🍕) doesn’t mean another will.\n\n\nSince the tokenizer.vocab is a Python dictionary, we can get a sample of the vocabulary using tokenizer.vocab.items().\nHow about we get the first 5?\n\n# Get the first 5 items in the tokenizer vocab\nsorted(tokenizer.vocab.items())[:5]\n\n[('!', 999), ('\"', 1000), ('#', 1001), ('##!', 29612), ('##\"', 29613)]\n\n\nThere’s our '!' from before! Looks like the first five items are all related to punctuation points.\nHow about a random sample of tokens?\n\nimport random\n\nrandom.sample(sorted(tokenizer.vocab.items()), k=5)\n\n[('##vies', 25929),\n ('responsibility', 5368),\n ('##pm', 9737),\n ('persona', 16115),\n ('rhythm', 6348)]\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Making a preprocessing function to tokenize text\nRather than tokenizing our texts one by one, it’s best practice to define a preprocessing function which does it for us.\nThis process works regardless of whether you’re working with text data or other kinds of data such as images or audio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning data into numbers\n\n\n\nFor any kind of machine learning workflow, an important first step is turning your input data into numbers.\nAs machine learning models are algorithms which find patterns in numbers, before they can find patterns in your data (text, images, audio, tables) it must be numerically encoded first (e.g. tokenizing text).\nTo help with this, transformers has an AutoProcessor class which can preprocess data in a specific format required for a paired model.\n\n\nTo prepare our text data, let’s create a preprocessing function to take in a dictionary which contains the key \"text\" which has the value of a target string (our data samples come in the form of dictionaries) and then returns the tokenized \"text\".\nWe’ll set the following parameters in our tokenizer:\n\npadding=True - This will make all the sequences in a batch the same length by padding shorter sequences with 0’s until they equal the longest size in the batch. Why? If there are different size sequences in a batch, you can sometimes run into dimensionality issues.\ntruncation=True - This will shorten sequences longer than the model can handle to the model’s max input size (e.g. if a sequence is 1000 long and the model can handle 512, it will be shortened to 512 via removing all tokens after 512).\n\nYou can see more parameters available for the tokenizer in the transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor more on padding and truncation (two important concepts in sequence processing), I’d recommend reading the Hugging Face documentation on Padding and Truncation.\n\n\n\ndef tokenize_text(examples):\n    \"\"\"\n    Tokenize given example text and return the tokenized text.\n    \"\"\"\n    return tokenizer(examples[\"text\"],\n                     padding=True, # pad short sequences to longest sequence in the batch\n                     truncation=True) # truncate long sequences to the maximum length the model can handle\n\nWonderful!\nNow let’s try it out on an example sample.\n\nexample_sample_2 = {\"text\": \"I love pizza\", \"label\": 1}\n\n# Test the function\ntokenize_text(example_sample_2)\n\n{'input_ids': [101, 1045, 2293, 10733, 102], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\n\nLooking good!\nHow about we map our tokenize_text function to our whole dataset?\nWe can do so with the datasets.Dataset.map method.\nThe map method allows us to apply a given function to all examples in a dataset.\nBy setting batched=True we can apply the given function to batches of examples (many at a time) to speed up computation time.\nLet’s create a tokenized_dataset object by calling map on our dataset and passing it our tokenize_text function.\n\n# Map our tokenize_text function to the dataset\ntokenized_dataset = dataset.map(function=tokenize_text, \n                                batched=True, # set batched=True to operate across batches of examples rather than only single examples\n                                batch_size=1000) # defaults to 1000, can be increased if you have a large dataset\n\ntokenized_dataset\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['text', 'label', 'input_ids', 'attention_mask'],\n        num_rows: 200\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['text', 'label', 'input_ids', 'attention_mask'],\n        num_rows: 50\n    })\n})\n\n\nDataset tokenized!\nLet’s inspect a pair of samples.\n\n# Get two samples from the tokenized dataset\ntrain_tokenized_sample = tokenized_dataset[\"train\"][0]\ntest_tokenized_sample = tokenized_dataset[\"test\"][0]\n\nfor key in train_tokenized_sample.keys():\n    print(f\"[INFO] Key: {key}\")\n    print(f\"Train sample: {train_tokenized_sample[key]}\")\n    print(f\"Test sample: {test_tokenized_sample[key]}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n[INFO] Key: text\nTrain sample: Set of headphones placed on a desk\nTest sample: A slice of pepperoni pizza with a layer of melted cheese\n\n[INFO] Key: label\nTrain sample: 0\nTest sample: 1\n\n[INFO] Key: input_ids\nTrain sample: [101, 2275, 1997, 2132, 19093, 2872, 2006, 1037, 4624, 102, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTest sample: [101, 1037, 14704, 1997, 11565, 10698, 10733, 2007, 1037, 6741, 1997, 12501, 8808, 102, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[INFO] Key: attention_mask\nTrain sample: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTest sample: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nBeautiful! Our samples have been tokenized.\nNotice the zeroes on the end of the inpud_ids and attention_mask values.\nThese are padding tokens to ensure that each sample has the same length as the longest sequence in a given batch.\nWe can now use these tokenized samples later on in our model.\n\n\n4.5 Tokenization takeaways\nWe’ve now seen and used tokenizers in practice.\nA few takeaways before we start to build a model:\n\nTokenizers are used to turn text (or other forms of data such as images and audio) into a numerical representation ready to be used with a machine learning model.\nMany models reuse existing tokenizers and many models have their own specific tokenizer paired with them. Hugging Face’s transformers.AutoTokenizer, transformers.AutoProcessor and transformers.AutoModel classes make it easy to pair tokenizers and models based on their name (e.g. distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased).",

    "text": "6 Setting up a model for training\nWe’ve gone through the important steps of setting data up for training (and evaluation).\nNow let’s prepare a model.\nWe’ll keep going through the following steps:\n\n✅ Create and preprocess data.\nDefine the model we’d like use with transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification (or another similar model class).\nDefine training arguments (these are hyperparameters for our model) with transformers.TrainingArguments.\nPass TrainingArguments from 3 and target datasets to an instance of transformers.Trainer.\nTrain the model by calling Trainer.train().\nSave the model (to our local machine or to the Hugging Face Hub).\nEvaluate the trained model by making and inspecting predctions on the test data.\nTurn the model into a shareable demo.\n\nLet’s start by creating an instance of a model.\nSince we’re working on text classification, we’ll do so with transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification (where sequence classification means a sequence of something, e.g. our sequences of text).\nWe can use the from_pretrained() method to instatiate a pretrained model from the Hugging Face Hub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe “pretrained” in transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained means acquiring a model which has already been trained on a certain dataset.\nThis is common practice in many machine learning projects and is known as transfer learning.\nThe idea is to take an existing model which works well on a task similar to your target task and then fine-tune it to work even better on your target task.\nIn our case, we’re going to use the pretrained DistilBERT base model (distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased) which has been trained on many thousands of books as well as a version of the English Wikipedia (millions of words).\nThis training gives it a very good baseline representation of the patterns in language.\nWe’ll take this baseline representation of the patterns in language and adjust it slightly to focus specifically on predicting whether an image caption is about food or not (based on the words it contains).\nThe main two benefits of using transfer learning are:\n\nAbility to get good results with smaller amounts of data (since the main representations are learned on a larger dataset, we only have to show the model a few examples of our specific problem).\nThis process can be repeated acorss various domains and tasks. For example, you can take a computer vision model trained on millions of images and customize it to your own use case. Or an audio model trained on many different nature sounds and customize it specifically for birds.\n\n\n\n\n\nTransfer learning is the process of taking what one model has learned from a (typically large) dataset and applying them to your own custom dataset. This process can be replicated across domains such as computer vision, natural language processing and more.\n\n\nSo when starting a new machine learning project, one of the first questions you should ask is: does an existing pretrained model similar to my task exist and can I fine-tune it for my own task?\nFor an end-to-end example of transfer learning in PyTorch (another popular deep learning framework), see PyTorch Transfer Learning.\n\n\nTime to setup our model instance.\nA few things to note:\n\nWe’ll use transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained, this will create the model architecture we specify with the pretrained_model_name_or_path parameter.\nThe AutoModelForSequenceClassification class comes with a classification head on top of our mdoel (so we can customize this to the number of classes we have with the num_labels parameter).\nUsing from_pretrained will also call the transformers.PretrainedConfig class which will enable us to set id2label and label2id parameters for our fine-tuning task.\n\nLet’s refresh what our id2label and label2id objects look like.\n\n# Get id and label mappings\nprint(f\"id2label: {id2label}\")\nprint(f\"label2id: {label2id}\")\n\nid2label: {0: 'not_food', 1: 'food'}\nlabel2id: {'not_food': 0, 'food': 1}\n\n\nBeautiful, we can pass these mappings to transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained.\n\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification\n\n# Setup model for fine-tuning with classification head (top layers of network)\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\n    pretrained_model_name_or_path=\"distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased\",\n    num_labels=2, # can customize this to the number of classes in your dataset\n    id2label=id2label, # mappings from class IDs to the class labels (for classification tasks)\n    label2id=label2id\n)\n\nSome weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.bias', 'pre_classifier.weight']\nYou should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n\n\nModel created!\nYou’ll notice that a warning message gets displayed:\n\nSome weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: [‘classifier.bias’, ‘classifier.weight’, ‘pre_classifier.bias’, ‘pre_classifier.weight’] You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n\nThis is essentially saying “hey, some of the layers in this model are newly initialized (with random patterns) and you should probably customize them to your own dataset”.\nThis happens because we used the AutoModelForSequenceClassification class.\nWhilst the majority of the layers in our model have already learned patterns from a large corpus of text, the top layers (classifier layers) have been randomly setup so we can customize them on our own.\n\n\n\n\nVarious forms of training paradigms. Typically you’ll start with a model that has been pretrained on a large dataset. For example, a base model could be one that has read all of Wikipedia + 1000’s of books (like our DistilBert model) and has a good general representation of language data. This representation can then be tailored to a specific use case by customizing the outputs and adjusting the representation slightly by feeding it custom data. This process is often referred to as fine-tuning.\n\n\nLet’s try and make a prediction with our model and see what happens.\n\n# Try and make a prediction with the loaded model (this will error)\nmodel(**tokenized_dataset[\"train\"][0])\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[40], line 2\n      1 # Try and make a prediction with the loaded model (this will error)\n----&gt; 2 model(**tokenized_dataset[\"train\"][0])\n\nFile ~/miniconda3/envs/learn_hf/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py:1553, in Module._wrapped_call_impl(self, *args, **kwargs)\n   1551     return self._compiled_call_impl(*args, **kwargs)  # type: ignore[misc]\n   1552 else:\n-&gt; 1553     return self._call_impl(*args, **kwargs)\n\nFile ~/miniconda3/envs/learn_hf/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py:1562, in Module._call_impl(self, *args, **kwargs)\n   1557 # If we don't have any hooks, we want to skip the rest of the logic in\n   1558 # this function, and just call forward.\n   1559 if not (self._backward_hooks or self._backward_pre_hooks or self._forward_hooks or self._forward_pre_hooks\n   1560         or _global_backward_pre_hooks or _global_backward_hooks\n   1561         or _global_forward_hooks or _global_forward_pre_hooks):\n-&gt; 1562     return forward_call(*args, **kwargs)\n   1564 try:\n   1565     result = None\n\nTypeError: DistilBertForSequenceClassification.forward() got an unexpected keyword argument 'text'\n\n\n\nOh no! We get an error.\nNot to worry, this is only because our model hasn’t been trained on our own dataset yet.\nLet’s take a look at the layers in our model.\n\n# Inspect the model \nmodel\n\nDistilBertForSequenceClassification(\n  (distilbert): DistilBertModel(\n    (embeddings): Embeddings(\n      (word_embeddings): Embedding(30522, 768, padding_idx=0)\n      (position_embeddings): Embedding(512, 768)\n      (LayerNorm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True)\n      (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)\n    )\n    (transformer): Transformer(\n      (layer): ModuleList(\n        (0-5): 6 x TransformerBlock(\n          (attention): MultiHeadSelfAttention(\n            (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)\n            (q_lin): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)\n            (k_lin): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)\n            (v_lin): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)\n            (out_lin): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)\n          )\n          (sa_layer_norm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True)\n          (ffn): FFN(\n            (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)\n            (lin1): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=3072, bias=True)\n            (lin2): Linear(in_features=3072, out_features=768, bias=True)\n            (activation): GELUActivation()\n          )\n          (output_layer_norm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True)\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  )\n  (pre_classifier): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)\n  (classifier): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=2, bias=True)\n  (dropout): Dropout(p=0.2, inplace=False)\n)\n\n\nYou’ll notice that the model comes in 3 main parts (data flows through these sequentially):\n\nembeddings - This part of the model turns the input tokens into a learned representation. So rather than just a list of integers, the values become a learned representation. This learned representation comes from the base model learning how different words and word pieces relate to eachother thanks to its training data. The size of (30522, 768) means the 30,522 words in the vocabulary are all represented by vectors of size 768 (one word gets represented by 768 numbers, these are often not human interpretable).\ntransformer - This is the main body of the model. There are several TransformerBlock layers stacked on top of each other. These layers attempt to learn a deeper representation of the data going through the model. A thorough breakdown of these layers is beyond the scope of this tutorial, however, for and in-depth guide on Transformer-based models, I’d recommend reading Transformers from scratch by Peter Bloem, going through Andrej Karpathy’s lecture on Transformers and their history or reading the original Attention is all you need paper (this is the paper that introduced the Transformer architecture).\nclassifier - This is what is going to take the representation of the data and compress it into our number of target classes (notice out_features=2, this means that we’ll get two output numbers, one for each of our classes).\n\nFor more on the entire DistilBert architecture and its training setup, I’d recommend reading the DistilBert paper from the Hugging Face team.\nRather than breakdown the model itself, we’re focused on using it for a particular task (classifying text).\n\n6.1 Counting the parameters of our model\nBefore we move into training, we can get another insight into our model by counting its number of parameters.\nLet’s create a small function to count the number of trainable (these will update during training) and total parameters in our model.\n\ndef count_params(model):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the parameters of a PyTorch model.\n    \"\"\"\n    trainable_parameters = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)\n    total_parameters = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())\n\n    return {\"trainable_parameters\": trainable_parameters, \"total_parameters\": total_parameters}\n\n# Count the parameters of the model\ncount_params(model)\n\n{'trainable_parameters': 66955010, 'total_parameters': 66955010}\n\n\nNice!\nLooks like our model has a total of 66,955,010 parameters and all of them are trainable.\nA parameter is a numerical value in a model which is capable of being updated to better represent the input data.\nI like to think of them as a small opportunity to learn patterns in the data.\nIf a model has three parameters, it has three small opportunities to learn patterns in the data.\nWhereas, if a model has 60,000,000+ (60M) parameters (like our model), it has 60,000,000+ small opportunities to learn patterns in the data.\nSome models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama 3 70B have 70,000,000,000+ (70B) parameters (over 1000x our model).\nIn essence, the more parameters a model has, the more opportunities it has to learn (generally).\nMore parameters often results in more capabilities.\nHowever, more parameters also often results in a much larger model size (e.g. many gigabytes versus hundreds of megabytes) as well as a much longer compute time (fewer samples per second).\nFor our use case, a binary text classification task, 60M parameters is more than enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy count the parameters in a model?\nWhile it may be tempting to always go with a model that has the most parameters, there are many considerations to take into account before doing so.\n\nWhat hardware is the model going to run on?\n\nIf you need the model to run on cheap hardware, you’ll likely want a smaller model.\n\nHow fast do you need the model to be?\n\nIf you need 100-1000s of predictions per second, you’ll likely want a smaller model.\n\n“I don’t mind about speed or cost, I just want quality.”\n\nGo with the biggest model you can.\nHowever, often times you can get really good results by training a small model to do a specific task using quality data than by just always using a large model.\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Create a directory for saving models\nTraining a model can take a while.\nSo we’ll want a place to save our models.\nLet’s create a directory called \"learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased\" (it’s a bit verbose and you can change this if you like but I like to be specific).\n\n# Create model output directory\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Create models directory\nmodels_dir = Path(\"models\")\nmodels_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n\n# Create model save name\nmodel_save_name = \"learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased\"\n\n# Create model save path\nmodel_save_dir = Path(models_dir, model_save_name)\n\nmodel_save_dir\n\nPosixPath('models/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased')\n\n\n\n\n6.3 Setting up training arguments with TrainingArguments\nTime to get our model ready for training!\nWe’re up to step 3 of our process:\n\n✅ Create and preprocess data.\n✅ Define the model we’d like use with transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification (or another similar model class).\nDefine training arguments (these are hyperparameters for our model) with transformers.TrainingArguments.\nPass TrainingArguments from 3 and target datasets to an instance of transformers.Trainer.\nTrain the model by calling Trainer.train().\nSave the model (to our local machine or to the Hugging Face Hub).\nEvaluate the trained model by making and inspecting predctions on the test data.\nTurn the model into a shareable demo.\n\nThe transformers.TrainingArguments class contains a series of helpful items, including hyperparameter settings and model saving strategies to use throughout training.\nIt has many parameters, too many to explain here.\nHowever, the following table breaks down a helpful handful.\nSome of the parameters we’ll set are the same as the defaults (this is on purpose as the defaults are often pretty good), some such as learning_rate are different.\n\n\n\nParameter\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\noutput_dir\nName of output directory to save the model and checkpoints to. For example, learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier_model.\n\n\nlearning_rate\nValue of the initial learning rate to use during training. Passed to transformers.AdamW. Initial learning rate because the learning rate can be dynamic during training. The ideal learning is experimental in nature. Defaults to 5e-5 or 0.00001 but we’ll use 0.0001.\n\n\nper_device_train_batch_size\nSize of batches to place on target device during training. For example, a batch size of 32 means the model will look at 32 samples at a time. A batch size too large will result in out of memory issues (e.g. your GPU can’t handle holding a large number of samples in memory at a time).\n\n\nper_device_eval_batch_size\nSize of batches to place on target device during evaluation. Can often be larger than during training because no gradients are being calculated. For example, training batch size could be 32 where as evaluation batch size may be able to be 128 (4x larger). Though these are only esitmates.\n\n\nnum_train_epochs\nNumber of times to pass over the data to try and learn patterns. For example, if num_train_epochs=10, the model will do 10 full passes of the training data. Because we’re working with a small dataset, 10 epochs should be fine to begin with. However, if you had a larger dataset, you may want to do a few experiments using less data (e.g. 10% of the data) for a smaller number of epochs to make sure things work.\n\n\neval_strategy\nWhen to evaluate the model on the evaluation data. If eval_strategy=\"epoch\", the model will be evaluated every epoch. See the documentation for more options. Note: This was previously called evaluation_strategy but was shortened in transformers==4.46.\n\n\nsave_strategy\nWhen to save a model checkpoint. If save_strategy=\"epoch\", a checkpoint will be saved every epoch. See the documentation for more save options.\n\n\nsave_total_limit\nNumber of total amount of checkpoints to save (so we don’t save num_train_epochs checkpoints). For example, can limit to 3 saves so the total number of saves are the 3 most recent as well as the best performing checkpoint (as per load_best_model_at_end).\n\n\nuse_cpu\nSet to False by default, will use CUDA GPU (torch.device(\"cuda\")) or MPS device (torch.device(\"mps\"), for Mac) if available. This is because training is generally faster on an accelerator device.\n\n\nseed\nSet to 42 by default for reproducibility. Meaning that subsequent runs with the same setup should achieve the same results.\n\n\nload_best_model_at_end\nWhen set to True, makes sure that the best model found during training is loaded when training finishes. This will mean the best model checkpoint gets saved regardless of what epoch it happened on. This is set to False by default.\n\n\nlogging_strategy\nWhen to log the training results and metrics. For example, if logging_strategy=\"epoch\", results will be logged as outputs every epoch. See the documentation for more logging options.\n\n\nreport_to\nLog experiments to various experiment tracking services. For example, you can log to Weights & Biases using report_to=\"wandb\". We’ll turn this off for now and keep logging to a local directory by setting report_to=\"none\".\n\n\npush_to_hub\nAutomatically upload the model to the Hugging Face Hub every time the model is saved. We’ll set push_to_hub=False as we’ll see how to do this manually later on. See the documentation for more options on saving models to the Hugging Face Hub.\n\n\nhub_token\nAdd your Hugging Face Hub token to push a model to the Hugging Face Hub with push_to_hub (will default to huggingface-cli login details).\n\n\nhub_private_repo\nWhether or not to make the Hugging Face Hub repository private or public, defaults to False (e.g. set to True if you want the repository to be private).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo get more familiar with the transformers.TrainingArguments class, I’d highly recommend reading the documentation for 15-20 minutes. Perhaps over a couple of sessions. There are quite a large number of parameters which will be helpful to be aware of.\n\n\nPhew!\nThat was a lot to take in.\nBut let’s now practice setting up our own instance of transformers.TrainingArguments.\n\nfrom transformers import TrainingArguments\n\nprint(f\"[INFO] Saving model checkpoints to: {model_save_dir}\")\n\n# Create training arguments\ntraining_args = TrainingArguments(\n    output_dir=model_save_dir,\n    learning_rate=0.0001,\n    per_device_train_batch_size=32,\n    per_device_eval_batch_size=32,\n    num_train_epochs=10,\n    eval_strategy=\"epoch\", # was previously \"evaluation_strategy\"\n    save_strategy=\"epoch\",\n    save_total_limit=3, # limit the total amount of save checkpoints (so we don't save num_epochs checkpoints)\n    use_cpu=False, # set to False by default, will use CUDA GPU or MPS device if available\n    seed=42, # set to 42 by default for reproducibility\n    load_best_model_at_end=True, # load the best model when finished training\n    logging_strategy=\"epoch\", # log training results every epoch\n    report_to=\"none\", # optional: log experiments to Weights & Biases/other similar experimenting tracking services (we'll turn this off for now) \n    # push_to_hub=True # optional: automatically upload the model to the Hub (we'll do this manually later on)\n    # hub_token=\"your_token_here\" # optional: add your Hugging Face Hub token to push to the Hub (will default to huggingface-cli login)\n    hub_private_repo=False # optional: make the uploaded model private (defaults to False)\n)\n\n# Optional: Print out training_args to inspect (warning, it is quite a long output)\n# training_args\n\n[INFO] Saving model checkpoints to: models/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased\n\n\nTraining arguments created!\nLet’s put them to work in an instance of transformers.Trainer.\n\n\n6.4 Setting up an instance of Trainer\nTime for step 4!\n\n✅ Create and preprocess data.\n✅ Define the model we’d like use with transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification (or another similar model class).\n✅ Define training arguments (these are hyperparameters for our model) with transformers.TrainingArguments.\nPass TrainingArguments from 3 and target datasets to an instance of transformers.Trainer.\nTrain the model by calling Trainer.train().\nSave the model (to our local machine or to the Hugging Face Hub).\nEvaluate the trained model by making and inspecting predctions on the test data.\nTurn the model into a shareable demo.\n\nThe transformers.Trainer class allows you to train models.\nIt’s built on PyTorch so it gets to leverage all of the powerful PyTorch toolkit.\nBut since it also works closely with the transformers.TrainingArguments class, it offers many helpful features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\ntransformers.Trainer can work with torch.nn.Module models, however, it is designed to work best with transformers.PreTrainedModel’s from the transformers library.\nThis is not a problem for us as we’re using transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained which loads a transformers.PreTrainedModel.\nSee the transformers.Trainer documentation for tips on how to make sure your model is compatible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nmodel\nThe model we’d like to train. Works best with an instance of transformers.PreTrainedModel. Most models loaded using from_pretrained will be of this type.\n\n\nargs\nInstance of transformers.TrainingArguments. We’ll use the training_args object we defined earlier. But if this is not set, it will default to the default settings for transformers.TrainingArguments.\n\n\ntrain_dataset\nDataset to use during training. We can use our tokenized_dataset[\"train\"] as it has already been preprocessed.\n\n\neval_dataset\nDataset to use during evaluation (our model will not see this data during training). We can use our tokenized_dataset[\"test\"] as it has already been preprocessed.\n\n\ntokenizer\nThe tokenizer which was used to preprocess the data. Passing a tokenizer will also pad the inputs to maximum length when batching them. It will also be saved with the model so future re-runs are easier.\n\n\ncompute_metrics\nAn evaluation function to evaluate a model during training and evaluation steps. In our case, we’ll use the compute_accuracy function we defined earlier.\n\n\n\nWith all this being said, let’s build our Trainer!\n\nfrom transformers import Trainer\n\n# Setup Trainer\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset[\"train\"],\n    eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset[\"test\"],\n    # Note: the 'tokenizer' parameter will be changed to 'processing_class' in Transformers v5.0.0\n    tokenizer=tokenizer, # Pass tokenizer to the Trainer for dynamic padding (padding as the training happens) (see \"data_collator\" in the Trainer docs)\n    compute_metrics=compute_accuracy\n)\n\nWoohoo! We’ve created our own trainer.\nWe’re one step closer to training!\n\n\n6.5 Training our text classification model\nWe’ve done most of the hard word setting up our transformers.TrainingArguments as well as our transformers.Trainer.\nNow how about we train a model?\nFollowing our steps:\n\n✅ Create and preprocess data.\n✅ Define the model we’d like use with transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification (or another similar model class).\n✅ Define training arguments (these are hyperparameters for our model) with transformers.TrainingArguments.\n✅ Pass TrainingArguments from 3 and target datasets to an instance of transformers.Trainer.\nTrain the model by calling Trainer.train().\nSave the model (to our local machine or to the Hugging Face Hub).\nEvaluate the trained model by making and inspecting predctions on the test data.\nTurn the model into a shareable demo.\n\nLooks like all we have to do is call transformers.Trainer.train().\nWe’ll be sure to save the results of the training to a variable results so we can inspect them later.\nLet’s try!\n\n# Train a text classification model\nresults = trainer.train()\n\n\n      \n      \n      [70/70 00:07, Epoch 10/10]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nEpoch\nTraining Loss\nValidation Loss\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\n1\n0.328100\n0.039627\n1.000000\n\n\n2\n0.019200\n0.005586\n1.000000\n\n\n3\n0.003700\n0.002026\n1.000000\n\n\n4\n0.001700\n0.001186\n1.000000\n\n\n5\n0.001100\n0.000858\n1.000000\n\n\n6\n0.000800\n0.000704\n1.000000\n\n\n7\n0.000800\n0.000619\n1.000000\n\n\n8\n0.000700\n0.000571\n1.000000\n\n\n9\n0.000600\n0.000547\n1.000000\n\n\n10\n0.000600\n0.000539\n1.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWoahhhh!!!\nHow cool is that!\nWe just trained a text classification model!\nAnd it looks like the training went pretty quick (thanks to our smaller dataset and relatively small model, for larger datasets, training would likely take longer).\nHow about we check some of the metrics?\nWe can do so using the results.metrics attribute (this returns a Python dictionary with stats from our training run).\n\n# Inspect training metrics\nfor key, value in results.metrics.items():\n    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n\ntrain_runtime: 7.5421\ntrain_samples_per_second: 265.177\ntrain_steps_per_second: 9.281\ntotal_flos: 18110777160000.0\ntrain_loss: 0.03574410408868321\nepoch: 10.0\n\n\nNice!\nLooks like our overall training runtime is low because of our small dataset.\nAnd looks like our trainer was able to process a fair few samples per second.\nIf we were to 1000x the size of our dataset (e.g. ~250 samples -&gt; ~250,000 samples which is quite a substantial dataset), it seems our training time still wouldn’t take too long.\nThe total_flos stands for “floating point operations” (also referred to as FLOPS), this is the total number of calculations our model has performed to find patterns in the data. And as you can see, it’s quite a large number!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDepending on the hardware you’re using, the results with respect to train_runtime, train_samples_per_second and train_steps_per_second will likely be different.\nThe faster your accelerator hardware (e.g. NVIDIA GPU or Mac GPU), the lower your runtime and higher your samples/steps per second will be.\nFor reference, on my local NVIDIA RTX 4090, I get a train_runtime of 8-9 seconds, train_samples_per_second of 230-250 and train_steps_per_second of 8.565.\n\n\n\n\n6.6 Save the model for later use\nNow our model has been trained, let’s save it for later use.\nWe’ll save it locally first and push it to the Hugging Face Hub later.\nWe can save our model using the transformers.Trainer.save_model method.\n\n# Save model\nprint(f\"[INFO] Saving model to {model_save_dir}\")\ntrainer.save_model(output_dir=model_save_dir)\n\n[INFO] Saving model to models/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased\n\n\nModel saved locally! Before we save it to the Hugging Face Hub, let’s check out its metrics.\n\n\n6.7 Inspecting the model training metrics\nWe can get a log of our model’s training state using trainer.state.log_history.\nThis will give us a collection of metrics per epoch (as long as we set logging_strategy=\"epoch\" in transformers.TrainingArguments), in particular, it will give us a loss value per epoch.\nWe can extract these values and inspect them visually for a better understanding our model training.\nLet’s get the training history and inspect it.\n\n# Get training history \ntrainer_history_all = trainer.state.log_history \ntrainer_history_metrics = trainer_history_all[:-1] # get everything except the training time metrics (we've seen these already)\ntrainer_history_training_time = trainer_history_all[-1] # this is the same value as results.metrics from above\n\n# View the first 4 metrics from the training history\ntrainer_history_metrics[:4]\n\n[{'loss': 0.3281,\n  'grad_norm': 0.6938912272453308,\n  'learning_rate': 9e-05,\n  'epoch': 1.0,\n  'step': 7},\n {'eval_loss': 0.03962664306163788,\n  'eval_accuracy': 1.0,\n  'eval_runtime': 0.0135,\n  'eval_samples_per_second': 3707.312,\n  'eval_steps_per_second': 148.292,\n  'epoch': 1.0,\n  'step': 7},\n {'loss': 0.0192,\n  'grad_norm': 0.14873287081718445,\n  'learning_rate': 8e-05,\n  'epoch': 2.0,\n  'step': 14},\n {'eval_loss': 0.005585948005318642,\n  'eval_accuracy': 1.0,\n  'eval_runtime': 0.0147,\n  'eval_samples_per_second': 3399.06,\n  'eval_steps_per_second': 135.962,\n  'epoch': 2.0,\n  'step': 14}]\n\n\nOkay, looks like the metrics are logged every epochs in a list Python dictionaries with interleaving loss (this is the training set loss) and eval_loss values.\nHow about we write some code to separate the training set metrics and the evaluation set metrics?\n\nimport pprint # import pretty print for nice printing of lists\n\n# Extract training and evaluation metrics\ntrainer_history_training_set = []\ntrainer_history_eval_set = []\n\n# Loop through metrics and filter for training and eval metrics\nfor item in trainer_history_metrics:\n    item_keys = list(item.keys())\n    # Check to see if \"eval\" is in the keys of the item\n    if any(\"eval\" in item for item in item_keys):\n        trainer_history_eval_set.append(item)\n    else:\n        trainer_history_training_set.append(item)\n\n# Show the first two items in each metric set\nprint(f\"[INFO] First two items in training set:\")\npprint.pprint(trainer_history_training_set[:2])\n\nprint(f\"\\n[INFO] First two items in evaluation set:\")\npprint.pprint(trainer_history_eval_set[:2])\n\n[INFO] First two items in training set:\n[{'epoch': 1.0,\n  'grad_norm': 0.6938912272453308,\n  'learning_rate': 9e-05,\n  'loss': 0.3281,\n  'step': 7},\n {'epoch': 2.0,\n  'grad_norm': 0.14873287081718445,\n  'learning_rate': 8e-05,\n  'loss': 0.0192,\n  'step': 14}]\n\n[INFO] First two items in evaluation set:\n[{'epoch': 1.0,\n  'eval_accuracy': 1.0,\n  'eval_loss': 0.03962664306163788,\n  'eval_runtime': 0.0135,\n  'eval_samples_per_second': 3707.312,\n  'eval_steps_per_second': 148.292,\n  'step': 7},\n {'epoch': 2.0,\n  'eval_accuracy': 1.0,\n  'eval_loss': 0.005585948005318642,\n  'eval_runtime': 0.0147,\n  'eval_samples_per_second': 3399.06,\n  'eval_steps_per_second': 135.962,\n  'step': 14}]\n\n\nBeautiful!\nHow about we take it a step further and turn our metrics into pandas DataFrames so we can view them easier?\n\n# Create pandas DataFrames for the training and evaluation metrics\ntrainer_history_training_df = pd.DataFrame(trainer_history_training_set)\ntrainer_history_eval_df = pd.DataFrame(trainer_history_eval_set)\n\ntrainer_history_training_df.head() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nloss\ngrad_norm\nlearning_rate\nepoch\nstep\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.3281\n0.693891\n0.00009\n1.0\n7\n\n\n1\n0.0192\n0.148733\n0.00008\n2.0\n14\n\n\n2\n0.0037\n0.037808\n0.00007\n3.0\n21\n\n\n3\n0.0017\n0.022227\n0.00006\n4.0\n28\n\n\n4\n0.0011\n0.018665\n0.00005\n5.0\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice!\nAnd the evaluation DataFrame?\n\ntrainer_history_eval_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neval_loss\neval_accuracy\neval_runtime\neval_samples_per_second\neval_steps_per_second\nepoch\nstep\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.039627\n1.0\n0.0135\n3707.312\n148.292\n1.0\n7\n\n\n1\n0.005586\n1.0\n0.0147\n3399.060\n135.962\n2.0\n14\n\n\n2\n0.002026\n1.0\n0.0136\n3680.635\n147.225\n3.0\n21\n\n\n3\n0.001186\n1.0\n0.0151\n3303.902\n132.156\n4.0\n28\n\n\n4\n0.000858\n1.0\n0.0159\n3146.137\n125.845\n5.0\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course, we’ll have follow the data explorer’s motto of visualize, visualize, visualize!

This method is similar to model card creation method above but with more customization.\n\nLet’s save our model to the Hub!\n\n# Save our model to the Hugging Face Hub\n# This will be public, since we set hub_private_repo=False in our TrainingArguments\nmodel_upload_url = trainer.push_to_hub(\n    commit_message=\"Uploading food not food text classifier model\",\n    # token=\"YOUR_HF_TOKEN_HERE\" # This will default to the token you have saved in your Hugging Face config\n)\nprint(f\"[INFO] Model successfully uploaded to Hugging Face Hub with at URL: {model_upload_url}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommitInfo(commit_url='https://huggingface.co/mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased/commit/8a8a8aff5bdee5bc518e31558447dc684d448b8f', commit_message='Uploading food not food text classifier model', commit_description='', oid='8a8a8aff5bdee5bc518e31558447dc684d448b8f', pr_url=None, pr_revision=None, pr_num=None)\n\n\nModel pushed to the Hugging Face Hub!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou may see the following error:\n\n403 Forbidden: You don’t have the rights to create a model under the namespace “mrdbourke”. Cannot access content at: https://huggingface.co/api/repos/create.

We can set these to be private or public. Models stored on the Hub can easily be accessed via Hugging Face Transformers.\n\n\nBut before we make an application/demo with our trained model, let’s keep evaluating it.",

    "text": "8 Making and inspecting predictions on custom text data\nWe’ve seen how our model performs on the test dataset (quite well).\nBut how might we check its performance on our own custom data?\nFor example, text-based image captions from the wild.\nWell, we’ve got two ways to load our model now too:\n\nLoad model locally from our computer (e.g. via models/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased).\nLoad model from Hugging Face Hub (e.g. via mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased).\n\nEither way of loading the model results in the same outcome: being able to make predictions on given data.\nSo how about we start by setting up our model paths for both local loading and loading from the Hugging Face Hub.\n\n# Setup local model path\nlocal_model_path = \"models/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased\"\n\n# Setup Hugging Face model path (see: https://huggingface.co/mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased)\n# Note: Be sure to change \"mrdbourke\" to your own Hugging Face username\nhuggingface_model_path = \"mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased\"\n\n\n8.1 Discussing ways to make predictions (inference)\nWhen we’ve loaded our trained model, because of the way we’ve set it up, there are two main ways to make predictions on custom data:\n\nPipeline mode using transformers.pipeline and passing it our target model, this allows us to preprocess custom data and make predictions in one step.\nPyTorch mode using a combination of transformers.AutoTokenizer and transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification and passing each our target model, this requires us to preprocess our data before passing to a model, however, it offers the most customization.\n\nEach method supports:\n\nPredictions one at a time (batch size of 1), for example, one person using the app at a time.\nBatches of predictions at a time (predictions with a batch size of n where n can be any number, e.g. 8, 16, 32), for example, many people using a service simultaneously such as a voice chat and needing to filter comments (predicting on batches of size n is usually much faster than batches of 1).\n\nWhichever method we choose, we’ll have to set the target device we’d like the operations to happen on.\nIn general, it’s best to make predictions on the most powerful accelerator you have available.\nAnd in most cases that will be a NVIDIA GPU &gt; Mac GPU &gt; CPU.\nSo let’s write a small function to pick the target device for us in that order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMaking predictions is also referred to as inference.\nBecause the model is going to infer on some data what the output should be.\nInference is often faster than training on a per sample basis as no model weights are updated (less computation).\nHowever, inference can use more compute than training over the long run because you could train a model once over a few hours (or days or longer) and then use it for inference for several months (or longer), millions of times (or more).\n\n\n\ndef set_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    Set device to CUDA if available, else MPS (Mac), else CPU.\n\n    This defaults to using the best available device (usually).\n    \"\"\"\n    if torch.cuda.is_available():\n        device = torch.device(\"cuda\")\n    elif torch.backends.mps.is_available() and torch.backends.mps.is_built():\n        device = torch.device(\"mps\")\n    else:\n        device = torch.device(\"cpu\")\n    return device\n\nDEVICE = set_device()\nprint(f\"[INFO] Using device: {DEVICE}\")\n\n[INFO] Using device: cuda\n\n\nTarget device set!\nLet’s start predicting.\n\n\n8.2 Making predictions with pipeline\nThe transformers.pipeline method creates a machine learning pipeline.\nData goes in one end and predictions come out the other end.\nYou can create pipelines for many different tasks, such as, text classification, image classification, object detection, text generation and more.\nLet’s see how we can create a pipeline for our text classification model.\nTo do so we’ll:\n\nInstantiate an instance of transformers.pipeline.\nPass in the task parameter of text-classification (we can do this because our model is already formatted for text classification thanks to using transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification).\nSetup the model parameter to be local_model_path (though we could also use huggingface_model_path).\nSet the target device using the device parameter.\nSet top_k=1 to get to the top prediction back (e.g. either \"food\" or \"not_food\", could set this higher to get more labels back).\nSet the BATCH_SIZE=32 so we can pass to the batch_size parameter. This will allow our model to make predictions on up to 32 samples at a time. Predicting on batches of data is usually much faster than single samples at a time, however, this often saturates at a point (e.g. predicting on batches of size 64 may be the same speed as 32 due to memory contraints).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are many more pipelines available in the Hugging Face documentation.\nAs an exericse, I’d spend 10-15 minutes reading through the pipeline documentation to get familiar with what’s available.\n\n\nLet’s setup our pipeline!\n\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\n# Set the batch size for predictions\nBATCH_SIZE = 32\n\n# Create an instance of transformers.pipeline\nfood_not_food_classifier = pipeline(task=\"text-classification\", # we can use this because our model is an instance of AutoModelForSequenceClassification\n                                    model=local_model_path, # could also pass in huggingface_model_path\n                                    device=DEVICE, # set the target device\n                                    top_k=1, # only return the top predicted value\n                                    batch_size=BATCH_SIZE) # perform predictions on up to BATCH_SIZE number of samples at a time \n\nfood_not_food_classifier\n\n&lt;transformers.pipelines.text_classification.TextClassificationPipeline at 0x7f2695245950&gt;\n\n\nWe’ve created an instance of transformers.pipelines.text_classification.TextClassificationPipeline!\nNow let’s test it out by passing it a string of text about food.\n\n# Test our trained model on some example text \nsample_text_food = \"A delicious photo of a plate of scrambled eggs, bacon and toast\"\nfood_not_food_classifier(sample_text_food)\n\n[[{'label': 'food', 'score': 0.9993335604667664}]]\n\n\nNice! Our model gets it right.\nHow about a string not about food?\n\n# Test the model on some more example text\nsample_text_not_food = \"A yellow tractor driving over the hill\"\nfood_not_food_classifier(sample_text_not_food)\n\n[[{'label': 'not_food', 'score': 0.9996254444122314}]]\n\n\nWoohoo!\nCorrect again!\nWhat if we passed in random text?\nAs in, someone types in something random to the model expecting an output.\n\n# Pass in random text to the model\nfood_not_food_classifier(\"cvnhertiejhwgdjshdfgh394587\")\n\n[[{'label': 'not_food', 'score': 0.9985743761062622}]]\n\n\nThe nature of machine learning models is that they are a predictive/generative function.\nIf you input data, they will output something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen deploying machine learning models, there are many things to take into consideration.\nOne of the main ones being: “what data is going to go into the model?”\nIf this was a public facing model and people could enter any kind of text, they could enter random text rather than a sentence about food or not food.\nSince our main goal of the model is be able to classify image captions into food/not_food, we’d also have to consider image cpations that are poorly written or contain little text.\nThis is why it’s important to continually test your models with as much example test/real-world data as you can.\n\n\nOur pipeline can also work with the model we saved to the Hugging Face Hub.\nLet’s try out the same pipeline with model=hugggingface_model_path.\n\n# Pipeline also works with remote models (will have to laod the model locally first)\nfood_not_food_classifier_remote = pipeline(task=\"text-classification\", \n                                           model=huggingface_model_path, # load the model from Hugging Face Hub (will download the model if it doesn't already exist)\n                                           batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,\n                                           device=DEVICE)\n\nfood_not_food_classifier_remote(\"This is some new text about bananas and pancakes and ice cream\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[{'label': 'food', 'score': 0.9993208646774292}]\n\n\nBeautiful!\nOur model loaded from Hugging Face gets it right too!\n\n\n8.3 Making multiple predictions at the same time with batch prediction\nWe can make predictions with our model one at a time but it’s often much faster to do them in batches.\nTo make predictions in batches, we can set up our transformers.pipeline instance with the batch_size parameter greater than 1.\nThen we’ll be able to pass multiple samples at once in the form of a Python list.\n\n# Create batch size (we don't need to do this again but we're doing it for clarity)\nBATCH_SIZE = 32 # this number is experimental and will require testing on your hardware to find the optimal value (e.g. lower if there are memory issues or higher to try speed up inference)\n\n# Setup pipeline to handle batches (we don't need to do this again either but we're doing it for clarity)\nfood_not_food_classifier = pipeline(task=\"text-classification\", \n                                    model=local_model_path,\n                                    batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,\n                                    device=DEVICE)\n\nWonderful, now we’ve set up a pipeline instance capable of handling batches, we can pass it a list of samples and it will make predictions on each.\nHow about we try with a collection of sentences which are a bit tricky?\n\n# Create a list of sentences to make predictions on\nsentences = [\n    \"I whipped up a fresh batch of code, but it seems to have a syntax error.\",\n    \"We need to marinate these ideas overnight before presenting them to the client.\",\n    \"The new software is definitely a spicy upgrade, taking some time to get used to.\",\n    \"Her social media post was the perfect recipe for a viral sensation.\",\n    \"He served up a rebuttal full of facts, leaving his opponent speechless.\",\n    \"The team needs to simmer down a bit before tackling the next challenge.\",\n    \"The presentation was a delicious blend of humor and information, keeping the audience engaged.\",\n    \"A beautiful array of fake wax foods (shokuhin sampuru) in the front of a Japanese restaurant.\",\n    \"Daniel Bourke is really cool :D\",\n    \"My favoruite food is biltong!\"\n]\n\nfood_not_food_classifier(sentences)\n\n[{'label': 'not_food', 'score': 0.9986234903335571},\n {'label': 'not_food', 'score': 0.9993952512741089},\n {'label': 'not_food', 'score': 0.9992876648902893},\n {'label': 'not_food', 'score': 0.9994683861732483},\n {'label': 'not_food', 'score': 0.9993450045585632},\n {'label': 'not_food', 'score': 0.9994571805000305},\n {'label': 'not_food', 'score': 0.9991866946220398},\n {'label': 'food', 'score': 0.9993101358413696},\n {'label': 'not_food', 'score': 0.9995250701904297},\n {'label': 'food', 'score': 0.9966572523117065}]\n\n\nWoah! That was quick!\nAnd it looks like our model performed fairly well.\nThough there was one harder sample which may be deemed as food/not_food, the sentence containing “shokuhin sampuru” (meaning “food model” in Japanese).\nIs a sentence about food models (fake foods) still about food?\n\n\n8.4 Time our model across larger sample sizes\nWe can say that our model is fast or that making predictions in batches is faster than one at a time.\nBut how about we run some tests to confirm this?\nLet’s start by making predictions one at a time across 100 sentences (10x our sentences list) and then we’ll write some code to make predictions in batches.\nWe’ll time each and see how they go.\n\nimport time\n\n# Create 1000 sentences\nsentences_1000 = sentences * 100\n\n# Time how long it takes to make predictions on all sentences (one at a time)\nprint(f\"[INFO] Number of sentences: {len(sentences_1000)}\")\nstart_time_one_at_a_time = time.time()\nfor sentence in sentences_1000:\n    # Make a prediction on each sentence one at a time\n    food_not_food_classifier(sentence)\nend_time_one_at_a_time = time.time()\n\nprint(f\"[INFO] Time taken for one at a time prediction: {end_time_one_at_a_time - start_time_one_at_a_time} seconds\")\nprint(f\"[INFO] Avg inference time per sentence: {(end_time_one_at_a_time - start_time_one_at_a_time) / len(sentences_1000)} seconds\")\n\n[INFO] Number of sentences: 1000\n[INFO] Time taken for one at a time prediction: 2.5376925468444824 seconds\n[INFO] Avg inference time per sentence: 0.0025376925468444823 seconds\n\n\nOk, on my local NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, it took around 5.5 seconds to make 1000 predictions one at a time.\nThat’s pretty good!\nBut let’s see if we can make it faster with batching.\nTo do so, we can increase the size of our sentences_big list and pass the list directly to the model to enable batched prediction.\n\nfor i in [10, 100, 1000, 10_000]:\n    sentences_big = sentences * i\n    print(f\"[INFO] Number of sentences: {len(sentences_big)}\")\n\n    start_time = time.time()\n    # Predict on all sentences in batches \n    food_not_food_classifier(sentences_big)\n    end_time = time.time()\n\n    print(f\"[INFO] Inference time for {len(sentences_big)} sentences: {round(end_time - start_time, 5)} seconds.\")\n    print(f\"[INFO] Avg inference time per sentence: {round((end_time - start_time) / len(sentences_big), 8)} seconds.\")\n    print()\n\n[INFO] Number of sentences: 100\n[INFO] Inference time for 100 sentences: 0.04512 seconds.\n[INFO] Avg inference time per sentence: 0.0004512 seconds.\n\n[INFO] Number of sentences: 1000\n[INFO] Inference time for 1000 sentences: 0.31447 seconds.\n[INFO] Avg inference time per sentence: 0.00031447 seconds.\n\n[INFO] Number of sentences: 10000\n[INFO] Inference time for 10000 sentences: 1.82615 seconds.\n[INFO] Avg inference time per sentence: 0.00018261 seconds.\n\n[INFO] Number of sentences: 100000\n[INFO] Inference time for 100000 sentences: 18.63373 seconds.\n[INFO] Avg inference time per sentence: 0.00018634 seconds.\n\n\n\nWoah!\nIt looks like inference/prediction time is ~10-20x faster when using batched prediction versus predicting one at a time (on my local NVIDIA RTX 4090).\nI ran some more tests with the same model on a different GPU on Google Colab (NVIDIA L4 GPU) and got similar results.\n\n\n\nNumber of Sentences\nTotal Prediction Time\nPrediction Type\n\n\n\n\n100\n0.62\none at a time\n\n\n1000\n6.19\none at a time\n\n\n10000\n61.08\none at a time\n\n\n100000\n605.46\none at a time\n\n\n100\n0.06\nbatch\n\n\n1000\n0.51\nbatch\n\n\n10000\n4.97\nbatch\n\n\n100000\n49.7\nbatch\n\n\n\nTesting the speed of a custom text classifier model on different numbers of sentences with one at a time or batched prediction.

See the notebook for code to reproduce.\n\n\n8.5 Making predictions with PyTorch\nWe’ve seen how to make predictions/perform inference with transformers.pipeline, now let’s see how to do the same with PyTorch.\nPerforming predictions with PyTorch requires an extra step compared to pipeline, we have to prepare our inputs first (turn the text into numbers).\nGood news is, we can prepare our inputs with the tokenizer that got automatically saved with our model.\nAnd since we’ve already trained a model and uploaded it to the Hugging Face Hub, we can load our model and tokenizer with transformers.AutoTokenizer and transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification passing it the saved path we used (mine is mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased).\nLet’s start by loading the tokenizer and see what it looks like to tokenize a piece of sample text.\n\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\n\n# Setup model path (can be local or on Hugging Face)\n# Note: Be sure to change \"mrdbourke\" to your own username\nmodel_path = \"mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased\"\n\n# Create an example to predict on\nsample_text_food = \"A delicious photo of a plate of scrambled eggs, bacon and toast\"\n\n# Prepare the tokenizer and tokenize the inputs\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_name_or_path=model_path)\ninputs = tokenizer(sample_text_food, \n                   return_tensors=\"pt\") # return the output as PyTorch tensors \ninputs\n\n{'input_ids': tensor([[  101,  1037, 12090,  6302,  1997,  1037,  5127,  1997, 13501,  6763,\n          1010, 11611,  1998, 15174,   102]]), 'attention_mask': tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])}\n\n\nNice!\nText tokenized!\nWe get a dictionary of input_ids (our text in token form) and attention_mask (tells the model which tokens to pay attention to, 1 = pay attention, 0 = no attention).\nNow we can load the model with the same path.\n\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification\n\n# Load our text classification model\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_name_or_path=model_path)\n\nModel loaded!\nLet’s make a prediction.\nWe can do so using the context manager torch.no_grad() (because no gradients/weights get updated during inference) and passing our model out inputs dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA little tidbit about using dictionaries as function inputs in Python is the ability to unpack the keys of the dictionary into function arguments.\nThis is possible using **TARGET_DICTIONARY syntax. Where the ** means “use all the keys in the dictionary as function parameters”.\nFor example, the following two lines are equivalent:\n# Using ** notation\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# Using explicit notation\noutputs = model(input_ids=inputs[\"input_ids\"],\n                attention_mask=inputs[\"attention_mask\"])\n\n\nLet’s make a prediction with PyTorch!\n\nimport torch\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    outputs = model(**inputs) # '**' means input all of the dictionary keys as arguments to the function\n    # outputs = model(input_ids=inputs[\"input_ids\"],\n    #                 attention_mask=inputs[\"attention_mask\"]) # same as above, but explicitly passing in the keys\n\noutputs\n\nSequenceClassifierOutput(loss=None, logits=tensor([[-3.3686,  3.9443]]), hidden_states=None, attentions=None)\n\n\nBeautiful, we’ve got some outputs, which contain logits with two values (one for each class).\nThe index of the higher value is our model’s predicted class.\nWe can find it by taking the outputs.logits and calling argmax().item() on it.\nWe can also find the prediction probability by passing outputs.logits to torch.softmax.\n\n# Get predicted class and prediction probability\npredicted_class_id = outputs.logits.argmax().item()\nprediction_probability = torch.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=1).max().item()\n\nprint(f\"Text: {sample_text_food}\")\nprint(f\"Predicted label: {model.config.id2label[predicted_class_id]}\")\nprint(f\"Prediction probability: {prediction_probability}\")\n\nText: A delicious photo of a plate of scrambled eggs, bacon and toast\nPredicted label: food\nPrediction probability: 0.9993335604667664\n\n\nBeautiful! A prediction made with pure PyTorch! It looks very much correct too.\nHow about we put it all together?\n\nimport torch\n\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification\n\nmodel_path = \"mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased\"\n\n# Load the model and tokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_name_or_path=model_path)\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_name_or_path=model_path)\n\n# Make sample text and tokenize it\nsample_text = \"A photo of a broccoli, salmon, rice and radish dish\"\ninputs = tokenizer(sample_text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\n# Make a prediction\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    outputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# Get predicted class and prediction probability\noutput_logits = outputs.logits\npredicted_class_id = torch.argmax(output_logits, dim=1).item()\npredicted_class_label = model.config.id2label[predicted_class_id]\npredicted_probability = torch.softmax(output_logits, dim=1).max().item()\n\n# Print outputs\nprint(f\"Text: {sample_text}\")\nprint(f\"Predicted class: {predicted_class_label} (prob: {predicted_probability * 100:.2f}%)\")\n\nText: A photo of a broccoli, salmon, rice and radish dish\nPredicted class: food (prob: 99.94%)",

    "text": "10 Turning our model into a demo\nOnce you’ve trained and saved a model, one of the best ways to continue to test it and show/share it with others is to create a demo.\nOr step number 8 in our workflow:\n\n✅ Create and preprocess data.\n✅ Define the model we’d like use with transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification (or another similar model class).\n✅ Define training arguments (these are hyperparameters for our model) with transformers.TrainingArguments.\n✅ Pass TrainingArguments from 3 and target datasets to an instance of transformers.Trainer.\n✅ Train the model by calling Trainer.train().\n✅ Save the model (to our local machine or to the Hugging Face Hub).\n✅ Evaluate the trained model by making and inspecting predctions on the test data.\nTurn the model into a shareable demo.\n\nA demo is a small application with the focus of showing the workflow of your model from data in to data out.\nIt’s also one way to start testing your model in the wild.\nYou may know where it works and where it doesn’t but chances are someone out there will find a new bug before you do.\nTo build our demo, we’re going to use an open-source library called Gradio.\nGradio allows you to make machine learning demo apps with Python code and best of all, it’s part of the Hugging Face ecosystem so you can share your demo to the public directly through Hugging Face.\n\n\n\n\nGoing on the premise of data, model, demo, Gradio helps to create the demo. Once you’ve got a trained model on the Hugging Face Hub, you can setup a Gradio interface to import that model and interact it with it. Gradio interfaces can be deployed on Hugging Face Spaces and shared with others so they can try your model too.\n\n\nGradio works on the premise of input -&gt; function (this could be a model) -&gt; output.\nIn our case:\n\nInput = A string of text.\nFunction = Our trained text classification model.\nOutput = Predicted output of food/not_food with prediction probability.\n\n\n10.1 Creating a simple function to perform inference\nLet’s create a function to take an input of text, process it with our model and return a dictionary of the predicted labels.\nOur function will:\n\nTake an input of a string of text.\nSetup a text classification pipeline using transformers.pipeline as well as our trained model (this can be from our local machine or loaded from Hugging Face). We’ll return all the probabilities from the output using top_k=None.\nGet the outputs of the text classification pipeline from 2 as a list of dictionaries (e.g. [{'label': 'food', 'score': 0.999105}, {'label': 'not_food', 'score': 0.00089}]).\nFormat and return the list of dictionaries from 3 to be compatible with Gradio’s gr.Label output (we’ll see this later) which requires a dictionary in the form [{\"label_1\": probability_1, \"label_2\": probability_2}].\n\nOnward!\n\nfrom typing import Dict\n\n# 1.

We can also add some descriptive aspects to our demo with the title, description and examples parameters.\nRunning/launching the demo with gr.Interface.launch().\n\n\n# 1. Import Gradio as the common alias \"gr\"\nimport gradio as gr\n\n# 2. Setup a Gradio interface to accept text and output labels\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    fn=food_not_food_classifier, \n    inputs=\"text\", \n    outputs=gr.Label(num_top_classes=2), # show top 2 classes (that's all we have)\n    title=\"Food or Not Food Classifier\",\n    description=\"A text classifier to determine if a sentence is about food or not food.\",\n    examples=[[\"I whipped up a fresh batch of code, but it seems to have a syntax error.\"],\n              [\"A delicious photo of a plate of scrambled eggs, bacon and toast.\"]])\n\n# 3. Launch the interface\ndemo.launch()\n\nRunning on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860\n\nTo create a public link, set `share=True` in `launch()`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWoohoo!\nWe’ve made a very clean way of interacting with our model.\nHowever, our model is still only largely accessible to us (except for the model file we’ve uploaded to Hugging Face).\nHow about we make our demo publicly available so it’s even easier for people to interact with our model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe gradio.Interface class is full of many different options, I’d highly recommend reading through the documentation for 10-15 minutes to get an idea of it.\nIf your workflow requires inputs -&gt; function (e.g. a model making predictions on the input) -&gt; output, chances are, you can build it with Gradio.",

    "text": "11 Making our demo publicly accessible\nOne of the best ways to share your machine learning work is by creating an application.\nAnd one of the best places to share your applications is Hugging Face Spaces.\nHugging Face Spaces allows you to host machine learning (and non-machine learning) applications for free (with optional paid hardware upgrades).\nIf you’re familiar with GitHub, Hugging Face Spaces works similar to a GitHub repository (each Space is a Git repository itself).\nIf not, that’s okay, think of Hugging Face Spaces as an online folder where you can upload your files and have them accessed by others.\nCreating a Hugging Face Space can be done in two main ways:\n\nManually - By going to the Hugging Face Spaces website and clicking “Create new space”. Or by going directly to https://www.huggingface.co/new-space. Here, you’ll be able to setup a few settings for your Space and choose the framework/runtime (e.g. Streamlit, Gradio, Docker and more).\nProgrammatically - By using the Hugging Face Hub Python API we can write code to directly upload files to the Hugging Face Hub, including Hugging Face Spaces.\n\nBoth are great options but we’re going to take the second approach.\nThis is so we can create our Hugging Face Space right from this notebook.\nTo do so, we’ll create three files:\n\napp.py - This will be the Python file which will be the main running file on our Hugging Face Space. Inside we’ll include all the code necessary to run our Gradio demo (as above). Hugging Face Spaces will automatically recoginize the app.py file and run it for us.\nrequirements.txt - This text file will include all of the Python packages we need to run our app.py file. Before our Space starts to run, all of the packages in this file will be installed.\nREADME.md - This markdown file will include details about our Space as well as specific Space-related metadata (we’ll see this later on).\n\nWe’ll create these files with the following file structure:\ndemos/\n└── food_not_food_text_classifier/\n    ├── app.py\n    ├── README.md\n    └── requirements.txt\nWhy this way?\nDoing it in the above style means we’ll have a directory which contains all of our demos (demos/) as well as a dedicated directory which contains our food/not_food demo application (food_not_food_text_classifier/).\nThis way, we’ll be able to upload the whole demos/food_not_food_text_classifier/ folder to Hugging Face Spaces.\nLet’s start by making a directory to store our demo application files.\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Make a directory for demos\ndemos_dir = Path(\"../demos\")\ndemos_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n\n# Create a folder for the food_not_food_text_classifer demo\nfood_not_food_text_classifier_demo_dir = Path(demos_dir, \"food_not_food_text_classifier\")\nfood_not_food_text_classifier_demo_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n\nDemo directory created, let’s now create our requried files.\n\n11.1 Making an app file\nOur app.py file will be the main part of our Hugging Face Space.\nThe good news is, we’ve already created most of it when we created our original demo.\nInside the app.py folder we’ll:\n\nImport the required libraries/packages for running our demo app.\nSetup a function for going from text to our trained model’s predicted outputs. And because our model is already hosted on the Hugging Face Hub, we can pass pipeline our model’s name (e.g. mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased) and when we upload our app.py file to Hugging Face Spaces, it will load the model directly from the Hub.\n\nNote: Be sure to change “mrdbourke” to your own Hugging Face username.\n\nCreate a demo just as before with gr.Interface.\nLaunch our demo with gr.Interface.launch.\n\nWe can write all of the above in a notebook cell.\nAnd we can turn it into a file by using the %%writefile magic command and passing it our target filepath.\nLet’s do it!\n\n%%writefile ../demos/food_not_food_text_classifier/app.py\n# 1.

The title of your Space (e.g. title: Food Not Food Text Classifier).\nemoji - The emoji to display on your Space (e.g. emoji: 🍗🚫🥑).\napp_file - The target app file for Spaces to run (set to app_file: app.py by default).\n\nAnd there are plenty more in the Spaces Configuration References documentation.\n\n\n\n\nExample of Hugging Face Spaces README.md file with YAML front matter (front matter is another term for “things at the front/top of the file”) for formatting the Space.\n\n\nLet’s create a README.md file with a YAML block at the top detailing some of the metadata about our project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe YAML block at the top of the README.md can take some practice.\nIf you want to see a demo of how one gets created, try making a Hugging Face Space with the “Create new Space” button on the https://huggingface.co/spaces page and seeing what the README.md file starts with (that’s how I found out what to do!).\n\n\n\n%%writefile ../demos/food_not_food_text_classifier/README.md\n---\ntitle: Food Not Food Text Classifier\nemoji: 🍗🚫🥑\ncolorFrom: blue\ncolorTo: yellow\nsdk: gradio\napp_file: app.py\npinned: false\nlicense: apache-2.0\n---\n\n# 🍗🚫🥑 Food Not Food Text Classifier\n\nSmall demo to showcase a text classifier to determine if a sentence is about food or not food.\n\nDistillBERT model fine-tuned on a small synthetic dataset of 250 generated [Food or Not Food image captions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_image_captions).\n\n[Source code notebook](https://github.com/mrdbourke/learn-huggingface/blob/main/notebooks/hugging_face_text_classification_tutorial.ipynb).\n\nOverwriting ../demos/food_not_food_text_classifier/README.md\n\n\nREADME.md created!\nNow let’s check out the files we have in our demos/food_not_food_text_classifier/ folder.\n\n!ls ../demos/food_not_food_text_classifier\n\nREADME.md  app.py  requirements.txt\n\n\nPerfect!\nLooks like we’ve got all the files we need to create our Space.\nLet’s upload them to the Hugging Face Hub.\n\n\n11.4 Uploading our demo to Hugging Face Spaces\nWe’ve created all of the files required for our demo, now for the fun part!\nLet’s upload them to Hugging Face Spaces.\nTo do so programmatically, we can use the Hugging Face Hub Python API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Hugging Face Hub Python API has many different options for interacting with the Hugging Face Hub programmatically.\nYou can create repositories, upload files, upload folders, add comments, change permissions and much much more.\nBe sure to explore the documentation for at least 10-15 minutes to get an idea of what’s possible.\n\n\nTo get our demo hosted on Hugging Face Spaces we’ll go through the following steps:\n\nImport the required methods from the huggingface_hub package, including create_repo, get_full_repo_name, upload_file (optional, we’ll be using upload_folder) and upload_folder.\nDefine the demo folder we’d like to upload as well as the different parameters for the Hugging Face Space such as repo type (\"space\"), our target Space name, the target Space SDK (\"gradio\"), our Hugging Face token with write access (optional if it already isn’t setup).\nCreate a repository on Hugging Face Spaces using the huggingface_hub.create_repo method and filling out the appropriate parameters.\nGet the full name of our created repository using the huggingface_hub.get_full_repo_name method (we could hard code this but I like to get it programmatically incase things change).\nUpload the contents of our target demo folder (../demos/food_not_food_text_classifier/) to Hugging Face Hub with huggingface_hub.upload_folder.\nHope it all works and inspect the results! 🤞\n\nA fair few steps but we’ve got this!\n\n# 1. Import the required methods for uploading to the Hugging Face Hub\nfrom huggingface_hub import (\n    create_repo,\n    get_full_repo_name,\n    upload_file, # for uploading a single file (if necessary)\n    upload_folder # for uploading multiple files (in a folder)\n)\n\n# 2. Define the parameters we'd like to use for the upload\nLOCAL_DEMO_FOLDER_PATH_TO_UPLOAD = \"../demos/food_not_food_text_classifier\"\nHF_TARGET_SPACE_NAME = \"learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier_demo\"\nHF_REPO_TYPE = \"space\" # we're creating a Hugging Face Space\nHF_SPACE_SDK = \"gradio\"\nHF_TOKEN = \"\" # optional: set to your Hugging Face token (but I'd advise storing this as an environment variable as previously discussed)\n\n# 3. Create a Space repository on Hugging Face Hub \nprint(f\"[INFO] Creating repo on Hugging Face Hub with name: {HF_TARGET_SPACE_NAME}\")\ncreate_repo(\n    repo_id=HF_TARGET_SPACE_NAME,\n    # token=HF_TOKEN, # optional: set token manually (though it will be automatically recognized if it's available as an environment variable)\n    repo_type=HF_REPO_TYPE,\n    private=False, # set to True if you don't want your Space to be accessible to others\n    space_sdk=HF_SPACE_SDK,\n    exist_ok=True, # set to False if you want an error to raise if the repo_id already exists \n)\n\n# 4. Get the full repository name (e.g. {username}/{model_id} or {username}/{space_name})\nfull_hf_repo_name = get_full_repo_name(model_id=HF_TARGET_SPACE_NAME)\nprint(f\"[INFO] Full Hugging Face Hub repo name: {full_hf_repo_name}\")\n\n# 5. Upload our demo folder\nprint(f\"[INFO] Uploading {LOCAL_DEMO_FOLDER_PATH_TO_UPLOAD} to repo: {full_hf_repo_name}\")\nfolder_upload_url = upload_folder(\n    repo_id=full_hf_repo_name,\n    folder_path=LOCAL_DEMO_FOLDER_PATH_TO_UPLOAD,\n    path_in_repo=\".\", # upload our folder to the root directory (\".\" means \"base\" or \"root\", this is the default)\n    # token=HF_TOKEN, # optional: set token manually\n    repo_type=HF_REPO_TYPE,\n    commit_message=\"Uploading food not food text classifier demo app.py\"\n)\nprint(f\"[INFO] Demo folder successfully uploaded with commit URL: {folder_upload_url}\")\n\n[INFO] Creating repo on Hugging Face Hub with name: learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier_demo\n[INFO] Full Hugging Face Hub repo name: mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier_demo\n[INFO] Uploading ../demos/food_not_food_text_classifier to repo: mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier_demo\n[INFO] Demo folder successfully uploaded with commit URL: https://huggingface.co/spaces/mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier_demo/tree/main/.\n\n\nExcellent!\nLooks like all of the files in our target demo folder were uploaded!\nOnce this happens, Hugging Face Spaces will take a couple of minutes to build our application.\nIf there are any errors, it will let us know.\nOtherwise, our demo application should be running live and be ready to test at a URL similar to: https://huggingface.co/spaces/mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier_demo (though you may have to swap my username “mrdbourke” for your own as well as the name you chose for the Space).\n\n\n11.5 Testing our hosted demo\nOne of the really cool things about Hugging Face Spaces is that we can share our demo application as a link so others can try it out.\nWe can also embed it right into our notebook.\nTo do so, we can go to the three dots in the top right of our hosted Space and select “Embed this Space”.\nWe then have the option to embed our Space using a JavaScript web component, HTML iframe or via the direct URL.\nSince Jupyter notebooks have the ability to render HTML via IPython.display.HTML, let’s embed our Space with HTML.\n\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\n\n\n# You can get embeddable HTML code for your demo by clicking the \"Embed\" button on the demo page\nHTML(data='''\n&lt;iframe\n    src=\"https://mrdbourke-learn-hf-food-not-food-text-classifier-demo.hf.space\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n    width=\"850\"\n    height=\"450\"\n&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;     \n''')\n\n\n     \n\n\nNow that’s cool!\nWe can try out our Food Not Food Text Classifier app from right within our notebook!",

Over time, you can build up a portfolio of machine learning-based projects to show future employers or clients and to help the community grow.\nThere are many more, but I’ll leave these for you to explore as extra-curriculum.\n\nA common machine learning workflow: dataset -&gt; model -&gt; demo.\nBefore a machine learning model is incorporated into a larger application, a very common workflow is to:\n\nFind an existing or create a new dataset for your specific problem.\nTrain/fine-tune and evaluate an existing model on your dataset.\nCreate a small demo application to test your trained model.\n\nWe’ve just gone through all of these steps for text classification!\nText classification is a very common problem in many business settings. If you have a similar problem but a different dataset, you can replicate this workflow.\nBuilding your own model has several advantages over using APIs.\nAPIs are very helpful to try something out.\nHowever, depending on your use case, you may often want to create your own custom model.\nTraining your own model can often result in faster predictions and far less running costs over time.\nThe Hugging Face ecosystem enables the creation of custom models for almost any kind of machine learning problem.",

How would you create your own binary text classification model on different classes?\n\nCreate ~10 or samples of your own text classes (e.g. 10 samples each of spam/not_spam emails) and retrain a text classification model.\nBonus: Share the model you’ve made in a demo just like we did here. Send it to me, I’d love to see it! My email is on my website.\n\nWe’ve trained our model on two classes (binary classification) but how might we increase that to 3 or more classes (multi-class classification)?\n\nHint: see the num_labels parameter in transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.\n\nOur model seems to work pretty good on our test data and on the few number of examples we tried manually. Can you find any examples where our model fails? For example, what kind of sentences does it struggle with? How could you fix this?\n\nHint: Our model has been trained on examples with at least 5-12 words, does it still work with short sentences? (e.g. “pie”).\nBonus: If you find any cases where our model doesn’t perform well, make an extra 10-20 examples of these and add them to the dataset and then retrain the model (you’ll have to lookup “how to add rows to an existing Hugging Face dataset”). How does the model perform after adding these additional samples?\n\nDatasets are fundamental to any machine learning project, getting to know how to process and interact with them is a fundamental skill. Spend 1 hour going through the Hugging Face Datasets tutorial.\n\nWrite 5 things you can do with Hugging Face Datasets and where they might come in handy.\n\nThe Hugging Face transformers library has many features. The following readings are to help understand a handful of them.\n\nSpend 10 minutes exploring the transformers.TrainingArguments documentation.\nSpend 10 minutes reading the transformers.Trainer documentation.\n\nSpend 10 minutes reading the Hugging Face model sharing documentation.\n\nSpend 10 minutes reading the Hugging Face transformers.pipeline documentation.\n\nWhat does a pipeline do?\nName 3 different kinds of pipelines and describe what they do in a sentence\n\n\nGradio is a powerful library for making machine learning demos, learning more about it will help you in future creations. Spend 10-15 minutes reading the Gradio quickstart documentation.\n\nWhat are 3 kinds of demos you can create?\nWhat are 3 different inputs and outputs you can make?",

    "text": "1 TK - Overview\nTK - Make an intro about being on the Trashify 🚮 team with a mission to make the world a cleaner place, trashify = using ML to incentivize people to pick up trash in their local area\nWelcome to the Learn Hugging Face Object Detection project!\nInside this project, we’ll learn bits and pieces about the Hugging Face ecosystem as well as how to build our own custom object detection model.\nWe’ll start with a collection of images with bounding box files as our dataset, fine-tune an existing computer vision model to detect items in an image and then share our model as a demo others can use.\nTK image - update cover image for object detection  \n\nWe’re going to put on our internship hats and build a food not food text classification model using tools from the Hugging Face ecosystem.\n\n\n–&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFeel to keep reading through the notebook but if you’d like to run the code yourself, be sure to go through the setup guide first.\n\n\n\n1.1 TK - What we’re going to build\nWe’re going to be bulding Trashify 🚮, an object detection model which incentivises people to pick up trash in their local area by detecting bin, trash, hand.\nIf all three items are detected, a person gets +1 point!\nFor example, say you were going for a walk around your neighbourhood and took a photo of yourself picking up a piece (with your hand or trash arm) of trash and putting it in the bin, you would get a point.\nWith this object detection model, you could deploy it to an application which would automatically detect the target classes and then save the result to an online leaderboard.\nThe incentive would be to score the most points, in turn, picking up the most piecces of trash, in a given area.\nMore specifically, we’re going to follow the following steps:\n\nData: Problem defintion and dataset preparation - Getting a dataset/setting up the problem space.\nModel: Finding, training and evaluating a model - Finding an object detection model suitable for our problem on Hugging Face and customizing it to our own dataset.\nDemo: Creating a demo and put our model into the real world - Sharing our trained model in a way others can access and use.\n\nBy the end of this project, you’ll have a trained model and demo on Hugging Face you can share with others:\n\nfrom IPython.display import HTML \n\nHTML(\"\"\"\n&lt;iframe\n    src=\"https://mrdbourke-trashify-demo-v3.hf.space\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n    width=\"850\"\n    height=\"850\"\n&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\"\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 TK - What is object detection?\nObject detection is the process of identifying and locating an item in an image.\nWhere item can mean almost anything.\nFor example:\n\nDetecting car licence plates in a video feed (videos are a series of images) for a parking lot entrance.\nDetecting delivery people walking towards your front door on a security camera.\nDetecting defects on a manufacturing line.\nDetecting pot holes in the road so repair works can automatically be scheduled.\nDetecting small pests (Varroa Mite) on the bodies of bees.\nDetecting weeds in a field so you know what to remove and what to keep.\n\n–\nTK - add examples of actual trash identification projects, see:\n\nGoogle using machine learning for trash identification — https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/stories/circular-economy-marketplace/\nTrashify website for identifying trash — https://www.trashify.tech/\nWaste management with deep learning — https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956053X23001915\nLabel Studio being used for labelling a trash dataset — https://labelstud.io/blog/ameru-labeling-for-a-greener-world/\n\n–\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote: Object detection is also sometimes referred to as image localization or object localization. For consistency, I will use the term object detection, however, either of these terms could substitute.\n\n\n\n\n\n* TK image - examples of where object detection is used\n\n\n\nImage classification deals with classifying an image as a whole into a single class, object detection endeavours to find the specific target item and where it is in an image.\nOne of the most common ways of showing where an item is in an image is by displaying a bounding box (a rectangle-like box around the target item).\nAn object detection model will often take an input image tensor in the shape [3, 640, 640] ([colour_channels, height, width]) and output a tensor in the form [class_name, x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max] or [class_name, x1, y1, x2, y2] (this is two ways to write the same example format, there are more formats, we’ll see these below in Table 1).\nWhere:\n\nclass_name = The classification of the target item (e.g. \"car\", \"person\", \"banana\", \"piece_of_trash\", this could be almost anything).\nx_min = The x value of the top left corner of the box.\ny_min = The y value of the top left corner of the box.\nx_max = The x value of the bottom right corner of the box.\ny_max = The y value of the bottom right corner of the box.\n\n– TK image – example of a bounding box on an image\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject detection bounding box formats\n\n\n\nWhen you get into the world of object detection, you will find that there are several different bounding box formats.\nThere are three major formats you should be familiar with: XYXY, XYWH, CXCYWH (there are more but these are the most common).\nKnowing which bounding box format you’re working with can be the difference between a good model and a very poor model (wrong bounding boxes = wrong outcome).\nWe’ll get hands-on with a couple of these in this project.\nBut for an in-depth example of all three, I created a guide on different bounding box formats and how to draw them, reading this should give a good intuition behind each style of bounding box.\n\n\n\n\n1.3 TK - Why train your own object detection models?\nYou can customize pre-trained models for object detection as well as API-powered models and LLMs such as Gemini, LandingAI and DINO-X.\nDepending on your requirements, there are several pros and cons for using your own model versus using an API.\nTraining/fine-tuning your own model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nControl: Full control over model lifecycle.\nCan be complex to get setup.\n\n\nNo usage limits (aside from compute constraints).\nRequires dedicated compute resources for training/inference.\n\n\nCan train once and deploy everywhere/whenever you want (for example, Tesla deploying a model to all self-driving cars).\nRequires maintenance over time to ensure performance remains up to par.\n\n\nPrivacy: Data can be kept in-house/app and doesn’t need to go to a third party.\nCan require longer development cycles compared to using existing APIs.\n\n\nSpeed: Customizing a small model for a specific use case often means it runs much faster on local hardware, for example, modern object detection models can achieve 70-100+ FPS (frames per second) on modern GPU hardware.\n\n\n\n\nUsing a pre-built model API:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nEase of use: often can be setup within a few lines of code.\nIf the model API goes down, your service goes down.\n\n\nNo maintenance of compute resources.\nData is required to be sent to a third-party for processing.\n\n\nAccess to the most advanced models.\nThe API may have usage limits per day/time period.\n\n\nCan scale if usage increases.\nCan be much slower than using dedicated models due to requiring an API call.\n\n\n\nFor this project, we’re going to focus on fine-tuning our own model.\n\n\n1.4 TK - Workflow we’re going to follow\nThe good news for us is that the Hugging Face ecosystem makes working on custom machine learning projects an absolute blast.\nAnd workflow is reproducible across several kinds of projects.\nStart with data (or skip this step and go straight to a model) -&gt; get/customize a model -&gt; build and share a demo.\nWith this in mind, our motto is data, model, demo!\nMore specifically, we’re going to follow the rough workflow of:\n\nCreate, preprocess and load data using Hugging Face Datasets.\nDefine the model we’d like use with transformers.AutoModelForObjectDetection (or another similar model class).\nDefine training arguments (these are hyperparameters for our model) with transformers.TrainingArguments.\nPass TrainingArguments from 3 and target datasets to an instance of transformers.Trainer.\nTrain the model by calling Trainer.train().\nSave the model (to our local machine or to the Hugging Face Hub).\nEvaluate the trained model by making and inspecting predctions on the test data.\nTurn the model into a shareable demo.\n\nI say rough because machine learning projects are often non-linear in nature.\nAs in, because machine learning projects involve many experiments, they can kind of be all over the place.\nBut this worfklow will give us some good guidelines to follow.\n\n\n\n\nA general Hugging Face workflow from idea to shared model and demo using tools from the Hugging Face ecosystem. You’ll notice some of the steps don’t match with our workflow outline above. This is because the text-based workflow outline above breaks some of the steps down for educational purposes. These kind of workflows are not set in stone and are more of guide than specific directions. See information on each of the tools in the Hugging Face documentation.",

    "text": "3 Getting a dataset\nOkay, now we’re got the required libraries, let’s get a dataset.\nGetting a dataset is one of the most important things a machine learning project.\nThe dataset you often determines the type of model you use as well as the quality of the outputs of that model.\nMeaning, if you have a high quality dataset, chances are, your future model could also have high quality outputs.\nIt also means if your dataset is of poor quality, your model will likely also have poor quality outputs.\nFor an object detection problem, your dataset will likely come in the form of a group of images as well as a file with annotations belonging to those images.\nFor example, you might have the following setup:\nfolder_of_images/\n    image_1.jpeg\n    image_2.jpeg\n    image_3.jpeg\nannotations.json\nWhere the annotations.json contains details about the contains of each image:\n\n\nannotations.json\n\n[\n    {\n        'image_path': 'image_1.jpeg', \n        'image_id': 42,\n        'annotations': \n            {\n                'file_name': ['image_1.jpeg'],\n                'image_id': [42],\n                'category_id': [1],\n                'bbox': [\n                            [360.20001220703125, 528.5, 177.1999969482422, 261.79998779296875],\n                        ],\n                'area': [46390.9609375]\n            },\n        'label_source': 'manual_prodigy_label',\n        'image_source': 'manual_taken_photo'\n    },\n\n    ...(more labels down here)\n]\n\nDon’t worry too much about the exact meaning of everything in the above annotations.json file for now (this is only one example, there are many different ways object detection information could be displayed).\nThe main point is that each target image is paired with an assosciated label.\nNow like all good machine learning cooking shows, I’ve prepared a dataset from earlier.\nTK image - dataset on Hugging Face\nIt’s stored on Hugging Face Datasets (also called the Hugging Face Hub) under the name mrdbourke/trashify_manual_labelled_images.\nThis is a dataset I’ve collected manually by hand (yes, by picking up 1000+ pieces of trash and photographing it) as well as labelled by hand (by drawing boxes on each image with a labelling tool called Prodigy).\n\n3.1 Loading the dataset\nTo load a dataset stored on the Hugging Face Hub we can use the datasets.load_dataset(path=NAME_OR_PATH_OF_DATASET) function and pass it the name/path of the dataset we want to load.\nIn our case, our dataset name is mrdbourke/trashify_manual_labelled_images (you can also change this for your own dataset).\nAnd since our dataset is hosted on Hugging Face, when we run the following code for the first time, it will download it.\nIf your target dataset is quite large, this download may take a while.\nHowever, once the dataset is downloaded, subsequent reloads will be mush faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting information about a function/method\n\n\n\nOne way to find out what a function or method does is to lookup the documentation.\nAnother way is to write the function/method name with a question mark afterwards.\nFor example:\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nload_dataset?\nGive it a try.\nYou should see some helpful information about what inputs the method takes and how they are used.\n\n\nLet’s load our dataset and check it out.\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\n# Load our Trashify dataset\ndataset = load_dataset(path=\"mrdbourke/trashify_manual_labelled_images\")\n\ndataset\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['image', 'image_id', 'annotations', 'label_source', 'image_source'],\n        num_rows: 1128\n    })\n})\n\n\nBeautiful!\nWe can see that there is a train split of the dataset already which currently contains all of the samples (1128 in total).\nThere are also some features that come with our dataset which are related to our object detection goal.\n\nprint(f\"[INFO] Length of original dataset: {len(dataset['train'])}\")\nprint(f\"[INFO] Dataset features:\") \n\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\npprint(dataset['train'].features)\n\n[INFO] Length of original dataset: 1128\n[INFO] Dataset features:\n{'annotations': Sequence(feature={'area': Value(dtype='float32', id=None),\n                                  'bbox': Sequence(feature=Value(dtype='float32',\n                                                                 id=None),\n                                                   length=4,\n                                                   id=None),\n                                  'category_id': ClassLabel(names=['bin',\n                                                                   'hand',\n                                                                   'not_bin',\n                                                                   'not_hand',\n                                                                   'not_trash',\n                                                                   'trash',\n                                                                   'trash_arm'],\n                                                            id=None),\n                                  'file_name': Value(dtype='string', id=None),\n                                  'image_id': Value(dtype='int64', id=None),\n                                  'iscrowd': Value(dtype='int64', id=None)},\n                         length=-1,\n                         id=None),\n 'image': Image(mode=None, decode=True, id=None),\n 'image_id': Value(dtype='int64', id=None),\n 'image_source': Value(dtype='string', id=None),\n 'label_source': Value(dtype='string', id=None)}\n\n\nNice!\nWe can see our dataset features contain the following fields:\n\nannotations - A sequence of values including a bbox field (short for bounding box) as well as category_id field which contains the target objects we’d like to identify in our images (['bin', 'hand', 'not_bin', 'not_hand', 'not_trash', 'trash', 'trash_arm']).\nimage - This contains the target image assosciated with a given set of annotations (in our case, images and annotations have been uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub together).\nimage_id - A unique ID assigned to a given sample.\nimage_source - Where the image came from (all of our images have been manually collected).\nlabel_source - Where the image label came from (all of our images have been manually labelled).\n\n\n\n3.2 Viewing a single sample from our data\nNow we’ve seen the features, let’s check out a single sample from our dataset.\nWe can index on a single sample of the \"train\" set just like indexing on a Python list.\n\n# View a single sample of the dataset\ndataset[\"train\"][42]\n\n{'image': &lt;PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=960x1280&gt;,\n 'image_id': 745,\n 'annotations': {'file_name': ['094f4f41-dc07-4704-96d7-8d5e82c9edb9.jpeg',\n   '094f4f41-dc07-4704-96d7-8d5e82c9edb9.jpeg',\n   '094f4f41-dc07-4704-96d7-8d5e82c9edb9.jpeg'],\n  'image_id': [745, 745, 745],\n  'category_id': [5, 1, 0],\n  'bbox': [[333.1000061035156,\n    611.2000122070312,\n    244.89999389648438,\n    321.29998779296875],\n   [504.0, 612.9000244140625, 451.29998779296875, 650.7999877929688],\n   [202.8000030517578,\n    366.20001220703125,\n    532.9000244140625,\n    555.4000244140625]],\n  'iscrowd': [0, 0, 0],\n  'area': [78686.3671875, 293706.03125, 295972.65625]},\n 'label_source': 'manual_prodigy_label',\n 'image_source': 'manual_taken_photo'}\n\n\nWe see a few more details here compared to just looking at the features.\nWe notice the image is a PIL.Image with size 960x1280 (width x height).\nAnd the file_name is a UUID (Universially Unique Identifier, made with uuid.uuid4()).\nThe bbox field in the annotations key contains a list of bounding boxes assosciated with the image.\nIn this case, there are 3 different bounding boxes.\nWith the category_id values of 5, 1, 0 (we’ll map these to class names shortly).\nLet’s inspect a single bounding box.\n\ndataset[\"train\"][42][\"annotations\"][\"bbox\"][0]\n\n[333.1000061035156, 611.2000122070312, 244.89999389648438, 321.29998779296875]\n\n\nThis array gives us the coordinates of a single bounding box in the format XYWH.\nWhere:\n\nX is the x-coordinate of the top left corner of the box (333.1).\nY is the y-coordinate of the top left corner of the box (611.2).\nW is the width of the box (244.9).\nH is the height of the box (321.3).\n\nAll of these values are in absolute pixel values (meaning an x-coordinate of 333.1 is 333.1 pixels across on the x-axis).\nHow do I know this?\nI know this because I created the box labels and this is the default value Prodigy (the labelling tool I used) outputs boxes.\nHowever, if you were to come across another bouding box dataset, one of the first steps would be to figure out what format your bounding boxes are in.\nWe’ll see more on bounding box formats shortly.\n\n\n3.3 Extracting the category names from our data\nBefore we start to visualize our sample image and bounding boxes, let’s extract the category names from our dataset.\nWe can do so by accessing the features attribute our of dataset and then following it through to find the category_id feature, this contains a list of our text-based class names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen working with different categories, it’s good practice to get a list or mapping (e.g. a Python dictionary) from category name to ID and vice versa.\nFor example:\n# Category to ID\n{\"class_name\": 0}\n\n# ID to Category\n{0: \"class_name\"}\nNot all datasets will have this implemented in an easy to access way, so it might take a bit of research to get it created.\n\n\nLet’s access the class names in our dataset and save them to a variable categories.\n\n# Get the categories from the dataset\n# Note: This requires the dataset to have been uploaded with this information setup, not all datasets will have this available.\ncategories = dataset[\"train\"].features[\"annotations\"].feature[\"category_id\"]\n\n# Get the names attribute\ncategories.names\n\n['bin', 'hand', 'not_bin', 'not_hand', 'not_trash', 'trash', 'trash_arm']\n\n\nBeautiful!\nWe get the following class names:\n\nbin - A rubbish bin or trash can.\nhand - A person’s hand.\nnot_bin - Negative version of bin for items that look like a bin but shouldn’t be identified as one.\nnot_hand - Negative version of hand for items that look like a hand but shouldn’t be identified as one.\nnot_trash - Negative version of trash for items that look like trash but shouldn’t be identified as it.\ntrash - An item of trash you might find on a walk such as an old plastic bottle, food wrapper, cigarette butt or used coffee cup.\ntrash_arm - A mechanical arm used for picking up trash.\n\nThe goal of our computer vision model will be: given an image, detect items belonging to these target classes if they are present.\n\n\n3.4 Creating a mapping from numbers to labels\nNow we’ve got our text-based class names, let’s create a mapping from label to ID and ID to label.\nFor each of these, Hugging Face use the terminology label2id and id2label respectively.\n\n# Map ID's to class names and vice versa\nid2label = {i: class_name for i, class_name in enumerate(categories.names)}\nlabel2id = {value: key for key, value in id2label.items()}\n\nprint(f\"Label to ID mapping:\\n{label2id}\\n\")\nprint(f\"ID to label mapping:\\n{id2label}\")\n# id2label, label2id\n\nLabel to ID mapping:\n{'bin': 0, 'hand': 1, 'not_bin': 2, 'not_hand': 3, 'not_trash': 4, 'trash': 5, 'trash_arm': 6}\n\nID to label mapping:\n{0: 'bin', 1: 'hand', 2: 'not_bin', 3: 'not_hand', 4: 'not_trash', 5: 'trash', 6: 'trash_arm'}\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Creating a colour palette\nOk we know which class name matches to which ID, now let’s create a dictionary of different colours we can use to display our bounding boxes.\nIt’s one thing to plot bounding boxes, it’s another thing to make them look nice.\nAnd we always want our plots looking nice!\nWe’ll colour the positive classes bin, hand, trash, trash_arm in nice bright colours.\nAnd the negative classes not_bin, not_hand, not_trash in a light red colour to indicate they’re the negative versions.\nOur colour dictionary will map class_name -&gt; (red, green, blue) (or RGB) colour values.\n\n# Make colour dictionary\ncolour_palette = {\n    'bin': (0, 0, 224),         # Bright Blue (High contrast with greenery) in format (red, green, blue)\n    'not_bin': (255, 80, 80),   # Light Red to indicate negative class\n\n    'hand': (148, 0, 211),      # Dark Purple (Contrasts well with skin tones)\n    'not_hand': (255, 80, 80),  # Light Red to indicate negative class\n\n    'trash': (0, 255, 0),       # Bright Green (For trash-related items)\n    'not_trash': (255, 80, 80), # Light Red to indicate negative class\n\n    'trash_arm': (255, 140, 0), # Deep Orange (Highly visible)\n}\n\nLet’s check out what these colours look like!\nIt’s the ABV motto: Always Be Visualizing!\nWe can plot our colours with matplotlib.\nWe’ll just have to write a small function to normalize our colour values from [0, 255] to [0, 1] (matplotlib expects our colour values to be between 0 and 1).\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Normalize RGB values to 0-1 range\ndef normalize_rgb(rgb_tuple):\n    return tuple(x/255 for x in rgb_tuple)\n\n# Turn colors into normalized RGB values for matplotlib\ncolors_and_labels_rgb = [(key, normalize_rgb(value)) for key, value in colour_palette.items()]\n\n# Create figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 7, figsize=(8, 1))\n\n# Flatten the axis array for easier iteration\nax = ax.flatten()\n\n# Plot each color square\nfor idx, (label, color) in enumerate(colors_and_labels_rgb):\n    ax[idx].add_patch(plt.Rectangle(xy=(0, 0), \n                                    width=1, \n                                    height=1, \n                                    facecolor=color))\n    ax[idx].set_title(label)\n    ax[idx].set_xlim(0, 1)\n    ax[idx].set_ylim(0, 1)\n    ax[idx].axis('off')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensational!\nNow we know what colours to look out for when we visualize our bounding boxes.",

In our case, we will halve our image and boxes.\n\nTurn the box coordinates into a torch.tensor (we’ll be using torchvision utilities to plot the image and boxes).\nConvert the box format from XYXY to XYWH using torchvision.ops.box_convert (we do this because torchvision.utils.draw_bounding_boxes requires XYXY format as input).\nGet a list of label names (e.g. \"bin\", \"trash\", etc) assosciated with each of the boxes as well as a list of colours to match (these will be from our colour_palette).\nDraw the boxes on the target image by:\n\nTurning the image into a tensor with torchvision.transforms.functional.pil_to_tensor.\nDraw the bounding boxes on our image tensor with torchvision.utils.draw_bounding_boxes.\nTurn the image and bounding box tensors back into a PIL image with torchvision.transforms.functional.pil_to_tensor.\n\n\nPhew!\nA fair few steps…\nBut we’ve got this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the terms XYXY or XYWH or all of the drawing methods sound a bit confusing or intimidating, don’t worry, there’s a fair bit going on here.\nWe’ll cover bounding box formats, such as XYXY shortly.\nIn the meantime, if you want to learn more about different bounding box formats and how to draw them, I wrote A Guide to Bounding Box Formats and How to Draw Them which you might find helpful.\n\n\n\n# Plotting a bounding box on a single image\nimport random\n\nimport torch\n\nfrom torchvision.ops import box_convert\nfrom torchvision.utils import draw_bounding_boxes\n\nfrom torchvision.transforms.functional import pil_to_tensor, to_pil_image \n\n# 1.

    "text": "5 Different bounding box formats\nWhen drawing our bounding box, we discussed the terms XYXY and XYWH.\nWell, we didn’t really discuss these at all…\nBut that’s why we’re here.\nOne of the most confusing things in the world of object detection is the different formats bounding boxes come in.\nAre your boxes in XYXY, XYWH or CXCYWH?\nAre they in absolute format?\nOr normalized format?\nPerhaps a table will help us.\nThe following table contains a non-exhaustive list of some of the most common bounding box formats you’ll come across in the wild.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Different bounding box formats\n\n\n\n\n\nBox format\nDescription\nAbsolute Example\nNormalized Example\nSource\n\n\n\n\nXYXY\nDescribes the top left corner coordinates (x1, y1) as well as the bottom right corner coordinates of a box.  Also referred to as:  [x1, y1, x2, y2]  or  [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]\n[8.9, 275.3, 867.5, 964.0]\n[0.009, 0.215, 0.904, 0.753]\nPASCAL VOC Dataset uses the absolute version of this format, torchvision.utils.draw_bounding_boxes defaults to the absolute version of this format.\n\n\nXYWH\nDescribes the top left corner coordinates (x1, y1) as well as the width (box_width) and height (box_height) of the target box. The bottom right corners (x2, y2) are found by adding the width and height to the top left corner coordinates (x1 + box_width, y1 + box_height).  Also referred to as:  [x1, y1, box_width, box_height]  or  [x_min, y_min, box_width, box_height]\n[8.9, 275.3, 858.6, 688.7]\n[0.009, 0.215, 0.894, 0.538]\nThe COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset uses the absolute version of this format, see the section under “bbox”.\n\n\nCXCYWH\nDescribes the center coordinates of the bounding box (center_x, center_y) as well as the width (box_width) and height (box_height) of the target box.  Also referred to as:  [center_x, center_y, box_width, box_height]\n[438.2, 619.65, 858.6, 688.7]\n[0.456, 0.484, 0.894, 0.538]\nNormalized version introduced in the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) paper and is used by many later forms of YOLO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Absolute or normalized format?\nIn absolute coordinate form, bounding box values are in the same format as the width and height dimensions (e.g. our image is 960x1280 pixels).\nFor example in XYXY format: [\"bin\", 8.9, 275.3, 867.5, 964.0]\nAn (x1, y1) (or (x_min, y_min)) coordinate of (8.9, 275.3) means the top left corner is 8.9 pixels in on the x-axis, and 275.3 pixels down on the y-axis.\nIn normalized coordinate form, values are between [0, 1] and are proportions of the image width and height.\nFor example in XYXY format: [\"bin\", 0.009, 0.215, 0.904, 0.753]\nA normalized (x1, y1) (or (x_min, y_min)) coordinate of (0.009, 0.215) means the top left corner is 0.009 * image_width pixels in on the x-axis and 0.215 * image_height down on the y-axis.\nTo convert absolute coordinates to normalized, you can divide x-axis values by the image width and y-axis values by the image height.\n\\[\nx_{\\text{normalized}} = \\frac{x_{\\text{absolute}}}{\\text{image\\_width}} \\quad y_{\\text{normalized}} = \\frac{y_{\\text{absolute}}}{\\text{image\\_height}}\n\\]\n\n\n5.2 Which bounding box format should you use?\nThe bounding box format you use will depend on the framework, model and existing data you’re trying to use.\nFor example, the take the following frameworks:\n\nPyTorch - If you’re using PyTorch pre-trained models, for example, torchvision.models.detection.fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn, you’ll want absolute XYXY ([x1, y1, x2, y2]) format.\nHugging Face Transformers - If you’re using a Hugging Face Transformers model such as RT-DETRv2, you’ll want to take note that outputs from the model can be of one type (e.g. CXCYWH) but they can be post-processed into another type (e.g. absolute XYXY).\nUltralytics YOLO - If you’re using a YOLO-like model such as Ultralytics YOLO, you’ll want normalized CXCYWH ([center_x, center_y, width, height]) format.\nGoogle Gemini - If you’re using Google Gemini to predict bounding boxes on your images, then you’ll want to pay attention to the special [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] (YXYX) normalized coordinates.\n\nOr if you note that someone has said their model is pre-trained on the COCO dataset, chances are the data has been formatted in XYWH format (see Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor more on different bounding box formats and how to draw them, see A Guide to Bounding Box Formats and How to Draw Them.\n\n\n\n# TK - should I functionize the plotting of boxes and image so we can do input/output with tensors + data augmentations on that (E.g. original: image, augmented: image),\n# - is this needed?",

    "section": "6 Getting an object detection model",
    "text": "6 Getting an object detection model\nThere are two main ways of getting an object detection model:\n\nBuilding it yourself. For example, constructing it layer by layer, testing it and training it on your target problem.\nUsing an existing one. For example, find an existing model on a problem space similar to your own and then adapt it via transfer learning (TK - add link to glossary) to your own task.\n\nIn our case, we’re going to focus on the latter.\nWe’ll be taking a pre-trained object detection model and fine-tuning it on our Trashify 🚮 dataset so it outputs the boxes and labels we’re after.\n\n6.1 Places to get object detection models\nInstead of building your own machine learning model from scratch, it’s common practice to take an existing model that works on similar problem space to yours and then fine-tune (TK - add link to glossary) it to your own use case.\nThere are several places to get object detection models:\n\n\n\nTable 2: Places to get pre-trained object detection models\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nHugging Face Hub\nOne the best places on the internet to find open-source machine learning models of nearly any kind. You can find pre-trained object detection models here such as facebook/detr-resnet-50, a model from Facebook (Meta) and microsoft/conditional-detr-resnet-50, a model from Microsoft. And RT-DETRv2, the model we’re going to use as our base model. Many of the models are permissively licensed, meaning you can use them for your own projects.\n\n\ntorchvision\nPyTorch’s built-in domain library for computer vision has several pre-trained object detection models which you can use in your own workflows.\n\n\npaperswithcode.com/task/object-detection\nWhilst not a direct place to download object detection models from, paperswithcode contains benchmarks for many machine learning tasks (including object detection) which shows the current state of the art (best performing) models and usually includes links to where to get the code.\n\n\nDetectron2\nDetectron2 is an open-source library to help with many of the tasks in detecting items in images. Inside you’ll find several pre-trained and adaptable models as well as utilities such as data loaders for object detection and segmentation tasks.\n\n\nYOLO Series\nA running series of “You Only Look Once” models. Usually, the higher the number, the better performing. For example, YOLOv11 by Ultralytics should outperform YOLOv10, however, this often requires testing on your own dataset. Beware of the license, it is under the AGPL-3.0 license which may cause issues in some organizations.\n\n\nmmdetection library\nAn open-source library from the OpenMMLab which contains many different open-source models as well as detection-specific utilties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you find a pre-trained object detection model, you’ll often see statements such as:\n\nConditional DEtection TRansformer (DETR) model trained end-to-end on COCO 2017 object detection (118k annotated images).\nSource: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/conditional-detr-resnet-50\n\nThis means the model has already been trained on the COCO object detection dataset which contains 118,000 images and 80 classes such as [\"cake\", \"person\", \"skateboard\"...].\nThis is a good thing.\nIt means that the model should have a fairly good starting point when we try to adapt it to our own project.\n\n\n6.2 Downloading our model from Hugging Face\nFor our Trashify 🚮 project we’re going to be using the pre-trained object detection model PekingU/rtdetr_v2_r50vd which was originally introduced in the paper RT-DETRv2: Improved Baseline with Bag-of-Freebies for Real-Time Detection Transformer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe term “DETR” stands for “DEtection TRansformer”.\nWhere “Transformer” refers to the Transformer neural network architecture, specifically the Vision Transformer (or ViT) rather than the Hugging Face transformers library (quite confusing, yes).\nSo DETR means “performing detection with the Transformer architecture”.\nAnd the “RT” part stands for “Real Time” as in, the model is capable at performing predictions at over 30 FPS (a standard rate for video feeds).\n\n\nTo use this model, there are some helpful documentation resources we should be aware of:\n\n\n\nTable 3: Model documentation resources\n\n\n\n\n\nResource\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nRT-DETRv2 documentation\nContains detailed information on each of the transformers.RTDetrV2 classes.\n\n\ntransformers.RTDetrV2Config\nContains the configuration settings for our model such as number of layers and other hyperparameters.\n\n\ntransformers.RTDetrImageProcessor\nContains several preprocessing on post processing functions and settings for data going into and out of our model. Here we can set values such as size in the preprocess method which will resize our images to a certain size. We can also use the post_process_object_detection method to process the raw outputs of our model into a more usable format. Note: Even though our model is RT-DETRv2, it uses the original RT-DETR processor.\n\n\ntransformers.RTDetrV2ForObjectDetection\nThis will enable us to load the RT-DETRv2 model weights and enable to pass data through them via the forward method.\n\n\ntransformers.AutoImageProcessor\nThis will enable us to create an instance of transformers.RTDetrImageProcessor by passing the model name PekingU/rtdetr_v2_r50vd to the from_pretrained method. Hugging Face Transformers uses several Auto Classes for various problem spaces and models.\n\n\ntransformers.AutoModelForObjectDetection\nEnables us to load the model architecture and weights for the RT-DETRv2 architecture by passing the model name PekingU/rtdetr_v2_r50vd to the from_pretrained method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll get hands-on which each of these throughout the project.\nFor now, if you’d like to read up more on each, I’d highly recommend it.\nKnowing how to navigate and read through a framework’s documentation is a very helpful skill to have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are other object detection models we could try on the Hugging Face Hub such as facebook/detr-resnet-50 or IDEA-Research/dab-detr-resnet-50-dc5-pat3.\nFor now, we’ll stick with PekingU/rtdetr_v2_r50vd.\nIt’s easy to get stuck figuring out which model to use instead of just trying one and seeing how it goes.\nBest to get something small working with one model and try another one later as part of a series of experiments to try and improve your results.\nSpoiler: After trying several different object detection models on our problem, I found PekingU/rtdetr_v2_r50vd to be one of the best. Perhaps the newer D-FINE model might do better but I leave this for exploration.\n\n\nWe can load our model with transformers.AutoModelForObjectDetection.from_pretrained and passing in the following parameters:\n\npretrained_model_name_or_path - Our target model, which can be a local path or Hugging Face model name (e.g. PekingU/rtdetr_v2_r50vd).\nlabel2id - A dictionary mapping our class names/labels to their numerical ID, this is so our model will know how many classes to output.\nid2label - A dictionary mapping numerical IDs to our class names/labels, so our model will know how many classes we’re working with and what their IDs are.\nignore_mismatched_sizes=True (default) - We’ll set this to True so that our model can be instatiated with a varying number of classes compared to what it may have been trained on (e.g. if our model was trained on the 91 classes from COCO, we only need 7).\n\nSee the full documentation for a full list of parameters we can use.\nLet’s create a model!\n\nimport warnings\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=UserWarning, module=\"torch.nn.modules.module\") # turn off warnings for loading the model (feel free to comment this if you want to see the warnings)\n\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForObjectDetection\n\nMODEL_NAME = \"PekingU/rtdetr_v2_r50vd\"\n\nmodel = AutoModelForObjectDetection.from_pretrained(\n    pretrained_model_name_or_path=MODEL_NAME,\n    label2id=label2id,\n    id2label=id2label,\n    # Original model was trained with a different number of output classes to ours\n    # So we'll ignore any mismatched sizes (e.g. 91 vs. 7)\n    # Try turning this to False and see what happens\n    ignore_mismatched_sizes=True, \n)\n\n# Uncomment to see full model archietecture\n# model\n\nSome weights of RTDetrV2ForObjectDetection were not initialized from the model checkpoint at PekingU/rtdetr_v2_r50vd and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:\n- model.decoder.class_embed.0.bias: found shape torch.Size([80]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([7]) in the model instantiated\n- model.decoder.class_embed.0.weight: found shape torch.Size([80, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([7, 256]) in the model instantiated\n- model.decoder.class_embed.1.bias: found shape torch.Size([80]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([7]) in the model instantiated\n- model.decoder.class_embed.1.weight: found shape torch.Size([80, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([7, 256]) in the model instantiated\n- model.decoder.class_embed.2.bias: found shape torch.Size([80]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([7]) in the model instantiated\n- model.decoder.class_embed.2.weight: found shape torch.Size([80, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([7, 256]) in the model instantiated\n- model.decoder.class_embed.3.bias: found shape torch.Size([80]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([7]) in the model instantiated\n- model.decoder.class_embed.3.weight: found shape torch.Size([80, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([7, 256]) in the model instantiated\n- model.decoder.class_embed.4.bias: found shape torch.Size([80]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([7]) in the model instantiated\n- model.decoder.class_embed.4.weight: found shape torch.Size([80, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([7, 256]) in the model instantiated\n- model.decoder.class_embed.5.bias: found shape torch.Size([80]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([7]) in the model instantiated\n- model.decoder.class_embed.5.weight: found shape torch.Size([80, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([7, 256]) in the model instantiated\n- model.denoising_class_embed.weight: found shape torch.Size([81, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([8, 256]) in the model instantiated\n- model.enc_score_head.bias: found shape torch.Size([80]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([7]) in the model instantiated\n- model.enc_score_head.weight: found shape torch.Size([80, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([7, 256]) in the model instantiated\nYou should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n\n\nBeautiful!\nWe’ve got a model ready.\nYou might’ve noticed a warning about the model needing to be trained on a down-stream task:\n\nSome weights of RTDetrV2ForObjectDetection were not initialized from the model checkpoint at PekingU/rtdetr_v2_r50vd and are newly initialized &gt;

)\n    )\n  )\n)\nIf we check out a few of our model’s layers, we can see that it is a combination of convolutional, attention, MLP (multi-layer perceptron) and linear layers.\nI’ll leave exploring each of these layer types for extra-curriculum, you can see the source code for the model in the modeling_rt_detr_v2.py file on the transformers GitHub.\nFor now, think of them as progressively pattern extractors.\nWe’ll feed our input image into our model and layer by layer it will manipulate the pixel values to try and extract patterns in a way so that its internal parameters matches the image to its input annotations.\nMore specifically, if we dive into the final two layer sections:\n\nclass_embed = classification head with out_features=7 (one for each of our labels, 'bin', 'hand', 'not_bin', 'not_hand', 'not_trash', 'trash', 'trash_arm']).\nbbox_embed = regression head with out_features=4 (one for each of our bbox coordinates, e.g. [center_x, center_y, width, height]).\n\n\nprint(f\"[INFO] Final classification layer: {model.class_embed}\\n\")\nprint(f\"[INFO] Final box regression layer: {model.bbox_embed}\")\n\n[INFO] Final classification layer:

    (0-1): 2 x Linear(in_features=256, out_features=256, bias=True)\n      (2): Linear(in_features=256, out_features=4, bias=True)\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n\nThese two layers are what are going to output the final predictions of our model in structure similar to our annotations.\nThe class_embed will output the predicted class label of a given bounding box output from bbox_predictor.\nIn essence, we are trying to get all of the pretrained patterns (also called parameters/weights & biases) of the previous layers to conform to the ideal outputs we’d like at the end.\n\n\n6.4 Counting the number of parameters in our model\nParameters are individual values which contribute to a model’s final output.\nParameters are also referred to as weights and biases.\nYou can think of these individual weights as small pushes and pulls on the input data to get it to match the input annotations.\nIf our weights were perfect, we could input an image and always get back the correct bounding boxes and class labels.\nIt’s very unlikely to ever have perfect weights (unless your dataset is very small) but we can make them quite good (and useful).\nWhen you have a good set of weights, this is known as a good representation.\nRight now, our weights have been trained on COCO, a collection of 91 different common objects.\nSo they have a fairly good representation of detecting general common objects, however, we’d like to fine-tune these weights to detect our target objects.\nImportantly, our model will not be starting from scratch when it begins to train.\nIt will instead take off from its existing knowledge of detecting common objects in images and try to adhere to our task.\nWhen it comes to parameters and weights, generally, more is better.\nMeaning the more parameters your model has, the better representation it can learn.\nFor example, ResNet50 (our computer vision backbone) has ~25 million parameters, about 100 MB in float32 precision or 50MB in float16 precision.\nWhereas a model such as Llama-3.1-405B has ~405 billion parameters, about 1.45 TB in float32 precision or 740 GB in float16 precision, about 16,000x more than ResNet50.\nHowever, as we can see having more parameters comes with the tradeoff of size and latency.\nFor each new parameter requires to be stored and it also adds an extra computation unit to your model.\nIn the case of Trashify, since we’d like our model to run on-device (e.g. make predictions live on an iPhone), we’d opt for the smallest number of parameters we could get acceptable results from.\nIf performance is your number 1 criteria and size and latency don’t matter, then you’d likely opt for the model with the largest number of parameters (though always evaluate these models on your own data, larger models are generally better, not always better).\nSince our model is built using PyTorch, let’s write a small function to count the number of:\n\nTrainable parameters (parameters which will be tweaked during training)\nNon-trainable parameters (parameters which will not be tweaked during training)\nTotal parameters (trainable parameters + non-trainable parameters)\n\n\n# Count the number of parameters in the model\ndef count_parameters(model):\n    \"\"\"Takes in a PyTorch model and returns the number of parameters.\"\"\"\n    trainable_parameters = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)\n

of the parameters to try and represent our data.\nIn practice, this is known as full fine-tuning, trying to fine-tune a large portion of the model to our data.\nThere are other methods for fine-tuning, such as feature extraction (where you only fine-tune the final layers of the model) and partial fine-tuning (where you fine-tune a portion of the model).\nAnd even methods such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) which fine-tunes an adaptor matrix as a compliment to the model’s parameters.\n\n\n6.5 Creating a function to build our model\nSince machine learning is very experimental, we may

    "text": "7 Aside: Processor to Model Pattern\nMany Hugging Face data loading and modelling workflows as well as machine learning workflows in general follow the pattern of:\n\nData -&gt; Preprocessor -&gt; Model\n\nTK image - can we make data -&gt; preprocessor -&gt; model look better? potentially a flow chart?\nMeaning, the raw input data gets preprocessed or transformed in some way before being passed to a model.\nPreprocessors and models are often loaded with an Auto Class.\nAn Auto Class pairs a preprocessor and model based on their model name or key.\nFor example:\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModel\n\n# Load raw data\nraw_data = load_data()\n\n# Define target model name\nMODEL_NAME = \"...\"\n\n# Load preprocessor and model (these two are often paired)\npreprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)\n\n# Preprocess data\npreprocessed_data = preprocessor.preprocess(raw_data)\n\n# Pass preprocessed data to model\noutput = model(preprocessed_data)\nThis is the same for our Trashify 🚮 project.\nWe’ve got our raw data (images and bounding boxes), however, they need to be preprocessed in order for our model to be able to handle them.\nPreviously we tried to pass a sample of raw data to our model and this errored.\nWe can fix this by first preprocessing our raw data with our model’s pair preprocessor and then passing to our model again.",

    "text": "8 Loading our model’s processor\nTime to get our raw data ready for our model!\nTo begin, let’s load our model’s processor.\nWe’ll use this to prepare our input images for the model.\nTo do so, we’ll use transformers.AutoImageProcessor and pass our target model name to the from_pretrained method.\nWe can set use_fast=True so the fast version of the processor is loaded (see more in the docs under transformers.RTDetrImageProcessorFast).\n\nfrom transformers import AutoImageProcessor\n\nMODEL_NAME = \"PekingU/rtdetr_v2_r50vd\"\n# MODEL_NAME = \"facebook/detr-resnet-50\" # Could also use this model as an another experiment\n\n# Load the image processor\nimage_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_name_or_path=MODEL_NAME,\n                                                     use_fast=True) # load the fast version of the processor\n\n# Check out the image processor\nimage_processor\n\nRTDetrImageProcessorFast {\n  \"crop_size\": null,\n  \"data_format\": \"channels_first\",\n  \"default_to_square\": false,\n  \"device\": null,\n  \"do_center_crop\": null,\n  \"do_convert_annotations\": true,\n  \"do_convert_rgb\": null,\n  \"do_normalize\": false,\n  \"do_pad\": false,\n  \"do_rescale\": true,\n  \"do_resize\": true,\n  \"format\": \"coco_detection\",\n  \"image_mean\": [\n    0.485,\n    0.456,\n    0.406\n  ],\n  \"image_processor_type\": \"RTDetrImageProcessorFast\",\n  \"image_std\": [\n    0.229,\n    0.224,\n    0.225\n  ],\n  \"input_data_format\": null,\n  \"pad_size\": null,\n  \"resample\": 2,\n  \"rescale_factor\": 0.00392156862745098,\n  \"return_segmentation_masks\": null,\n  \"return_tensors\": null,\n  \"size\": {\n    \"height\": 640,\n    \"width\": 640\n  }\n}\n\n\nOk, a few things going on here.\nThese parameters will transform our input images before we pass them to our model.\nOne of the first things to see is the image_processor is expecting our bounding boxes to be in COCO (or coco_detection) format (this is the default).\nWe’ll see what this looks like later on but our processor wants this format because that’s the format our model has been trained on (it’s generally best practice to input data to a model in the same way its been trained on, otherwise you might get poor results).\nAnother thing to notice is that our input images will be resized to the values of the size parameter.\nIn our case, it’s currently:\n\"size\": {\n    \"height\": 640,\n    \"width\": 640\n}\nWhich means that input image will get resized to be 640x640 pixels (height x width).\nWe’ll keep these dimensions but we’ll update it to use \"longest_edge\": 640 and \"shortest_edge: 640\" (this will maintain aspect ratio).\nYou can read more about what each of these does in the transformers.RTDetrImageProcessor documentation.\nLet’s update our instance of transformers.RTDetrImageProcessor with a few custom parameters:\n\ndo_convert_annotations=True - This is the default and it will convert our boxes to the format CXCYWH or (center_x, center_y, width, height) (see Table 1) in the range [0, 1].\nsize - We’ll update the size dictionary so all of our images have \"longest_edge\": 640 and \"shortest_edge: 640\". We’ll use a value of 640 which is a common size in world of object detection. But there are also other sizes such as 300x300, 480x480, 512x512, 800x800 and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDepending on what task you’re working on, you might want to tweak the image resolution you’re working with.\nFor example, I like this quote from Lucas Beyer, a former research scientist at DeepMind and engineer at OpenAI:\n\nMy conservative claim is that you can always stretch to a square, and for:\nnatural images, meaning most photos, 224px² is enough; text in photos, phone screens, diagrams and charts, 448px² is enough; desktop screens and single-page documents, 896px² is enough.\n\nTypically, in the case of object detection, you’ll want to use a higher value.\nBut this is another thing that is open to experimentation.\n\n\n\n# Set image size\nIMAGE_SIZE = 640 # we could try other sizes here: 300x300, 480x480, 512x512, 640x640, 800x800 (best to experiment and see which works best)\n\n# Create a new instance of the image processor with the desired image size\nimage_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(\n    pretrained_model_name_or_path=MODEL_NAME,\n    use_fast=True, # use the fast preprocessor\n    format=\"coco_detection\", # this is the default\n    do_convert_annotations=True, # defaults to True, converts boxes to (center_x, center_y, width, height) in range [0, 1]\n    size={\"shortest_edge\": IMAGE_SIZE, \n          \"longest_edge\": IMAGE_SIZE},\n    return_segmentation_masks=True,\n    do_pad=True # make sure all images have 640x640 size thanks to padding\n)\n\n# Optional: View the docstring of our image_processor.preprocess function\n# image_processor.preprocess?\n\n# Check out our new image processor size\nimage_processor.size\n\n{'shortest_edge': 640, 'longest_edge': 640}\n\n\nBeautiful!\nNow our images will be resized to a square of size 640x640 when we pass them to our model.\nHow about we try to preprocess our random_sample?\nTo do so, we can pass its \"image\" key and \"annotations\" key to our image_processor’s preprocess method (we can also just called image_processor directly as it will call preprocess via the __call__ method).\nLet’s try!\n\nimage_processor\n\nRTDetrImageProcessorFast {\n  \"crop_size\": null,\n  \"data_format\": \"channels_first\",\n  \"default_to_square\": false,\n  \"device\": null,\n  \"do_center_crop\": null,\n  \"do_convert_annotations\": true,\n  \"do_convert_rgb\": null,\n  \"do_normalize\": false,\n  \"do_pad\": true,\n  \"do_rescale\": true,\n  \"do_resize\": true,\n  \"format\": \"coco_detection\",\n  \"image_mean\": [\n    0.485,\n    0.456,\n    0.406\n  ],\n  \"image_processor_type\": \"RTDetrImageProcessorFast\",\n  \"image_std\": [\n    0.229,\n    0.224,\n    0.225\n  ],\n  \"input_data_format\": null,\n  \"pad_size\": null,\n  \"resample\": 2,\n  \"rescale_factor\": 0.00392156862745098,\n  \"return_segmentation_masks\": true,\n  \"return_tensors\": null,\n  \"size\": {\n    \"longest_edge\": 640,\n    \"shortest_edge\": 640\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n# Try to process a single image and annotation pair (spoiler: this will error)\nrandom_sample_preprocessed = image_processor.preprocess(images=random_sample[\"image\"],\n                                                        annotations=random_sample[\"annotations\"])\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[24], line 2\n      1 # Try to process a single image and annotation pair (spoiler: this will error)\n----&gt; 2 random_sample_preprocessed = image_processor.preprocess(images=random_sample[\"image\"],\n      3                                                         annotations=random_sample[\"annotations\"])\n\nFile ~/miniconda3/envs/ai/lib/python3.11/site-packages/transformers/models/rt_detr/image_processing_rt_detr_fast.py:403, in RTDetrImageProcessorFast.preprocess(self, images, annotations, masks_path, **kwargs)\n    380 @auto_docstring\n    381 def preprocess(\n    382     self,\n   (...)\n    386     **kwargs: Unpack[RTDetrFastImageProcessorKwargs],\n    387 ) -&gt; BatchFeature:\n    388     r\"\"\"\n    389     annotations (`AnnotationType` or `List[AnnotationType]`, *optional*):\n    390         List of annotations associated with the image or batch of images.

Annotations must a dict (single image) or list of dicts (batch of images) with the following keys: image_id and annotations, with the latter being a list of annotations in the COCO format.\n\n\n8.1 Preprocessing a single image\nOkay so it turns out that our annotations aren’t in the format that the preprocess method was expecting.\nSince our pre-trained model was trained on the COCO dataset, the preprocess method expects input data to be in line with the COCO format.\nWe can fix this later on by adjusting our annotations.\nHow about we try to preprocess just a single image instead?\n\n# Preprocess our target sample\nrandom_sample_preprocessed_image_only = image_processor(images=random_sample[\"image\"],\n                                                        annotations=None, # no annotations this time \n                                                        masks_path=None, # no masks inputs\n                                                        return_tensors=\"pt\") # return as PyTorch tensors\n\n# Uncomment to see the full output\n# print(random_sample_preprocessed_image_only)\n\n# Print out the keys of the preprocessed image\nprint(random_sample_preprocessed_image_only.keys())\n\ndict_keys(['pixel_mask', 'pixel_values'])\n\n\nNice! It looks like the preprocess method works on a single image.\nAnd it seems like we get a dictionary output with the following keys:\n\npixel_values - the processed pixel values of the input image.\n(Optional) pixel_mask - a mask multiplier for the pixel values as to whether they should be paid attention to or not (a value of 0 means the pixel value should be ignored by the model and a value of 1 means the pixel value should be paid attention to by the model).\n\nBeautiful!\nNow how about we inspect our processed image’s shape?\n\n# Uncomment to inspect all preprocessed pixel values\n# print(random_sample_preprocessed_image_only[\"pixel_values\"][0])\n\nprint(f\"[INFO] Original image shape: {random_sample['image'].size} -&gt; [width, height]\")\nprint(f\"[INFO] Preprocessed image shape: {random_sample_preprocessed_image_only['pixel_values'].shape} -&gt; [batch_size, colour_channles, height, width]\")\n\n[INFO] Original image shape: (960, 1280) -&gt; [width, height]\n[INFO] Preprocessed image shape: torch.Size([1, 3, 640, 480]) -&gt; [batch_size, colour_channles, height, width]\n\n\nOk wonderful, it looks like our image has been downsized to [3, 640, 480] (1 item in the batch, 3 colour channels, 640 pixels high, 480 pixels wide).\nThis is down from its original size of [960, 1280] (1280 pixels high, 960 pixels wide).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe order of image dimensions can differ between libraries and frameworks.\nFor example, image tensors in PyTorch typically follow the format [colour_channels, height, width] whereas in TensorFlow they follow [height, width, colour_channels].\nAnd in PIL, the format is [width, height].\nAs you can imagine, this can get confusing.\nHowever, with some practice, you’ll be able to decipher which is which.\nAnd if your images and bounding boxes start looking strange, perhaps checking the image dimension and format can help.\n\n\n\n\n8.2 Trying to pass a single sample through our model (part 2)\nThis is exciting!\nWe’ve processed an image into the format our model is expecting.\nHow about we try another forward by calling model.forward(pixel_values, pixel_mask)?\nWhich is the same as calling model(pixel_values, pixel_mask).\n\n# Do a single forward pass with the model\nrandom_sample_outputs = model(\n    pixel_values=random_sample_preprocessed_image_only[\"pixel_values\"], # model expects input [batch_size, color_channels, height, width]\n    # pixel_mask=random_sample_preprocessed_image_only[\"pixel_mask\"], # some object detection models expect masks\n)\n\n# Inspect the outputs\n#

RTDetrV2ObjectDetectionOutput object as output.\nLet’s inspect the keys() method of this output and see what they are.\n\n# Check the keys of the output\nrandom_sample_outputs.keys()\n\nodict_keys(['logits', 'pred_boxes', 'last_hidden_state', 'intermediate_hidden_states', 'intermediate_logits', 'intermediate_reference_points', 'encoder_last_hidden_state', 'init_reference_points', 'enc_topk_logits', 'enc_topk_bboxes', 'enc_outputs_class', 'enc_outputs_coord_logits'])\n\n\nBreaking these down:\n\nlogits - The raw outputs from the model, these are the classification logits we can later apply a softmax function/sigmoid function to to get prediction probabilties.\npred_boxes - Normalized box coordinates in CXCYWH ((center_x, center_y, width, height)) format.\nlast_hidden_state - Last hidden state of the last decoder layer of the model.\nencoder_last_hidden_state - Last hidden state of the last encoder layer of the model.\n\nHow about we inspect the shape attribute of the logits?\n\n# Inspect logits output shape\noutput_logits = random_sample_outputs.logits\nprint(f\"[INFO] Output logits shape: {output_logits.shape} -&gt; [1 image, 300 boxes, 7 classes]\")\n\n[INFO] Output logits shape: torch.Size([1, 300, 7]) -&gt; [1 image, 300 boxes, 7 classes]\n\n\nNice!\nWe get an output from our model that coincides with the shape of our data.\nThe final value of 7 in the output_logits tensor is equivalent to the number of classes we have.\nAnd the 300 is the number of boxes our model predicts for each image (this is defined by the num_queries parameter of the transformers.RTDetrV2Config, where num_queries=300 is the default).\n\n# Inspect predicted boxes output shape\noutput_pred_boxes = random_sample_outputs.pred_boxes\nprint(f\"[INFO] Output predicted boxes shape: {output_pred_boxes.shape} -&gt; [1 image, 300 boxes, 4 coordinates (center_x, center_y, width, height)]\")\n\n[INFO] Output predicted boxes shape: torch.Size([1, 300, 4]) -&gt; [1 image, 300 boxes, 4 coordinates (center_x, center_y, width, height)]\n\n\nReading the documentation for the forward method, we can determine the output format of our models predicted boxes:\n\nReturns:\npred_boxes (torch.FloatTensor of shape (batch_size, num_queries, 4)) — Normalized boxes coordinates for all queries, represented as (center_x, center_y, width, height). These values are normalized in [0, 1], relative to the size of each individual image in the batch (disregarding possible padding). You can use post_process_object_detection() to retrieve the unnormalized bounding boxes.\n\nThis is good to know!\nIt means that the raw output boxes from our model come in normalized CXCYWH format (see Table 1 for more).\nHow about we inspect a single box?\n\n# Single example predicted bounding box coordinates\nprint(f\"[INFO] Example output box: {output_pred_boxes[:, 0, :][0].detach()} -&gt; (center_x, center_y, width, height)\")\n\n[INFO] Example output box: tensor([0.5340, 0.3919, 0.1037, 0.0970]) -&gt; (center_x, center_y, width, height)\n\n\nExcellent!\nWe can process these boxes and logits later on into different formats using the transformers.RTDetrImageProcessor.post_process_object_detection method.\nFor now, let’s figure out how to preprocess our annotations.",

Each annotation should be a dictionary. An image can have no annotations, in which case the list should be empty.\n\nAs for the \"annotations\" field, this should be a list of dictionaries containing individual annotations in COCO format:\n# COCO format, see: https://cocodataset.org/#format-data  \n[{\n    \"image_id\": 42,\n    \"annotations\": [{\n        \"id\": 123456,\n        \"category_id\": 1,\n        \"iscrowd\": 0,\n        \"segmentation\": [\n            [42.0, 55.6, ... 99.3, 102.3]\n        ],\n        \"image_id\": 42, # this matches the 'image_id' field above\n        \"area\": 135381.07,\n        \"bbox\": [523.70,\n                 545.09,\n                 402.79,\n                 336.11]\n    },\n    # Next annotation in the same format as the previous one (one annotation per dict).\n    # For example, if an image had 4 bounding boxes, there would be a list of 4 dictionaries\n    # each containing a single annotation.\n    ...]\n}]\nLet’s breakdown each of the fields in the COCO annotation:\n\n\n\nTable 4: COCO data format keys breakdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nRequirement\nData Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nimage_id (top-level)\nRequired\nInteger\nID of the target image.\n\n\nannotations\nRequired\nList[Dict]\nList of dictionaries with one box annotation per dict.

This may be a single instance of SingleCOCOAnnotation or multiple.\n\nWe’ll decorate both of these with the @dataclass decorator.\nUsing a @dataclass gives several benefits:\n\nType hints - we can define the types of objects we want in the class definition, for example, we want image_id to be an int.\nHelpful built-in methods - we can use methods such as asdict to convert our @dataclass into a dictionary (COCO wants lists of dictionaries).\nData validation - we can use methods such as __post_init__ to run checks on our @dataclass as it’s initialized, for example, we always want the length of bbox to be 4 (bounding box coordinates in XYWH format).\n\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, asdict\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\n# 1.

    "text": "13 Preparing data at scale\nWe’ve performed preprocessing and postprocessing steps on a single data sample.\nHowever, in practice, we’ll likely want to work with many more samples.\nOur model is hungry for more data.\nSo let’s step it up a notch and write some code that’s capable of preprocessing many samples to pass to our model.\nWe’ll break it down into three subsections:\n\nSplitting the data into training, validation and test sets. We’ll train our model on the training set and check its performance on the validation and test sets (our model won’t see any of these samples during training). We perform these splits before preprocessing the samples in them in case we’d like to perform different preprocessing steps depending on the split. For example, we may want to use data augmentation on the training set and not use it on the testing set.\nPreprocessing multiple samples at a time by iterating over groups of samples. Rather than preprocess a single sample at a time, we’ll write code capable of processing lists of examples simultaneously.\nCollate samples into batches so our model can view multiple samples simultaneously. Rather than performing a forward pass on a single sample at a time, we’ll pass batches of data to the model. For example, we may pass 32 samples (image and label pairs) at a time to our model for it to try and learn the patterns between them. We use batches of data rather than the whole dataset as it’s often much more memory efficient. If you have a really large dataset, all of your samples may not fit into memory at once, so in practice, you break it up into smaller batches of samples.\n\nLet’s start by splitting the data into different sets.\n\n13.1 Splitting the data into training and test sets\nRight now our data is all in one big group.\nHowever, it’s best practice to split our data into two (or three) different sets:\n\nTraining set (~70-80% of data) - This is the data the model will learn from, all samples in this set are seen by the model during training.\nValidation set (~5-20% of data) - This is the data we can fine-tune our model’s hyperparameters on, all samples in this set are not seen by the model during training.\nTest set (~5-20% of data) - This is the data we will evaluate what our model has learned after going through the training set, all samples in this set are not seen by the model during training.\n\nUsing the analogy of a student at univeristy, the training set would be the course materials throughout the semester, the validation set would be the practice exam and the test set would be the final exam.\nIf a student doesn’t perform well on the final exam, then we would usually say perhaps the course materials weren’t of the highest quality.\nThis is similar to our machine learning workflow.\nIn an ideal world, the samples in the training set are sufficiently representative of those in the test set and in turn, sufficiently representative of samples in the wild.\nBefore we split our dataset into different sets, let’s remind ourselves of what it looks like.\n\n# Original dataset (only a \"train\" split)\ndataset = load_dataset(path=\"mrdbourke/trashify_manual_labelled_images\")\noriginal_dataset_length = len(dataset[\"train\"])\ndataset\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['image', 'image_id', 'annotations', 'label_source', 'image_source'],\n        num_rows: 1128\n    })\n})\n\n\nWonderful! Right now, we’ve only got one split, \"train\".\nTo make our required splits, we can call the train_test_split() method on our dataset and pass in the size of the split we’d like via the test_size parameter.\nFor example, test_size=0.3 means 30% of the data will go to the test set and 70% will go to the training set.\nWe’ll make the following splits:\n\n70% of data to training set.\n~10% of data to validation set.\n~20% of data to testing set.\n\nTo do so, we’ll call train_test_split() twice with different amounts:\n\nFirst on dataset[\"train\"] with test_size=0.3 to make the 70/30 training/test split, we’ll save this split to the variable dataset_split.\nNext on dataset_split[\"test\"] with test_size=0.66 to make the 66/33 test/validation split, we’ll set this variable to dataset_test_val_split.\n\nOnce we’ve done this, we’ll reassign all of the splits back to our original dataset.\nWe’ll also set seed=42 for reproducibility.\nLet’s do it!\nTK image - make an image of these workflows to make it easier to understand\n\n# Note: Be careful of running this cell multiple times, if you do, the dataset size will get smaller. \n# If this happens, just reload the whole `dataset` as above.\n\n# 1. Split the data into \"train\" and \"test\" splits\ndataset_split = dataset[\"train\"].train_test_split(test_size=0.3, seed=42) # split the dataset into 70/30 train/test\n\n# 2. Split the test split into \"test\" and \"validation\" splits\ndataset_test_val_split = dataset_split[\"test\"].train_test_split(test_size=0.66, seed=42) # split the test set into 40/60 validation/test\n\n# Create \"train\" split from 1.\ndataset[\"train\"] = dataset_split[\"train\"]\n\n# Create a \"validation\" and \"test\" split from 2.\ndataset[\"validation\"] = dataset_test_val_split[\"train\"]\ndataset[\"test\"] = dataset_test_val_split[\"test\"]\n\n# Ensure splits lengths add to equal original dataset length (otherwise there's a mistmatch somewhere)\nassert original_dataset_length == len(dataset[\"train\"]) + len(dataset[\"validation\"]) + len(dataset[\"test\"]), \"Total dataset split lengths don't equal original dataset length, is there a mismatch? Perhaps try reloading the original dataset and re-running this cell.\"\n\n# View the dataset (now with splits)\ndataset\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['image', 'image_id', 'annotations', 'label_source', 'image_source'],\n        num_rows: 789\n    })\n    validation: Dataset({\n        features: ['image', 'image_id', 'annotations', 'label_source', 'image_source'],\n        num_rows: 115\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['image', 'image_id', 'annotations', 'label_source', 'image_source'],\n        num_rows: 224\n    })\n})\n\n\nPerfect!\nNow we’ve got three splits of our dataset to work with.\nWe’ll make sure our model never sees the validation and test splits during training, so when evaluate it we know that it’s only seeing new samples.\n\n\n13.2 TK - Writing a function for preprocessing multiple samples at a time\nWe’ve preprocessed and passed one sample through our model, new let’s do the same for multiple samples.\nWe’re going to work towards having a function that can go from a group or batch of samples (images and their annotations) and return them in preprocessed form (via transformers.RTDetrImageProcessor.preprocess) ready to be used with our model.\nLet’s first remind ourselves of what a single unprocessed sample looks like.\n\n# Get one sample from the training dataset \none_sample = dataset[\"train\"][42]\none_sample\n\n{'image': &lt;PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=960x1280&gt;,\n 'image_id': 663,\n 'annotations': {'file_name': ['1d2ea64a-0296-403d-93cd-31e3f116c995.jpeg',\n

and then preparing it for the preprocess method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOur data is in this structure (a dictionary of lists, rather than a list of dictionaries) because it is built on Hugging Face Datasets and Hugging Face Datasets is built on Apache Arrow.\nAnd Apache Arrow is column-orientated in nature.\nSo instead of our dataset being represented as many rows (list of dictionaries), it is represented as many columns (dictionary of lists).\n\n\nThe preprocess method expects a list of images as well as COCO formatted annotations as input.\nSo to create our preprocess_batch function we’ll:\n\nTake in a list of examples (these will be in the format above), an image_processor and optional transforms (we don’t need to pass these in for now but it’s good to have the option).\nCreate empty lists of images and coco_annotations we’ll fill throughout the rest of the function.\nExtract the image, image_id and annotations_dict from our list of input examples.\nCreate lists of annotations attributes such as bbox, category_id and area (these are required for our format_image_annotations_as_coco function.\nOptionally perform transforms/augmentations on the image and related boxes (because in object detection if you transform an image, should transform the related boxes as well).\nConvert the annotations into COCO format using the format_image_annotations_as_coco helper function we created earlier.\nAppend the images and COCO formatted annotations to the empty lists created in 2.\nPass the list of images and COCO formatted annotations to the image_processor.preprocess method to get the preprocessed batch.\nReturn the preprocessed batch.\n\nLet’s do it!\n\n# 1.

Make a models directory for saving models\nmodels_dir = Path(\"models\")\nmodels_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n\nPerfect! Time to setup our model’s hyperparameters with transformers.TrainingArguments.\n\n14.1 Setting up our TrainingArguments\nThe transformers.TrainingArguments class holds many of the hyperparameters/settings for training our model.\nMany of them are set by default in the transformers.RTDetrV2Config class.\nHowever, we can tweak any of them to our own liking.\nWhere do we get the settings from?\nThe original RT-DETRv2: Improved Baseline with Bag-of-Freebies for Real-Time Detection Transformer paper states that all hyperparameters are the same as the original RT-DETR (see Table A in DETRs Beat YOLOs on Real-time Object Detection).\nThe main hyperparameters we are going to set are:\n\n\n\nHyperparameter\nValue\nWhat does it do?\n\n\n\n\nper_device_train_batch_size, per_device_eval_batch_size\n16, 32 or larger (hardware dependent)\nDefines the number of samples passed to our model at one time. For example, if batch size is 16, our model will see 16 samples at a time. It’s usually best practice to set this value to the highest your hardware can handle.\n\n\nlearning_rate\n0.0001 (as per the listed papers)\nDefines the multiplier on the size of gradient updates during training. Too high and gradients will explode, too low and gradients won’t update, both lead to poor training results. The papers mention two different learning rates for the backbone and the detection head, I tried these and got poor results (likely because of our smaller dataset), a single learning rate for the whole network turned out to be better.\n\n\nweight_decay\n0.0001 (as per the listed papers)\nPrevents model weights from getting too large by applying a small decay penalty over time. This prevents a single weight providing too much information. In essence, the model is forced to learn smaller, simpler weights to represent the data. A form of regularization (overfitting prevention). See more at paperswithcode.com/method/weight-decay.\n\n\nmax_grad_norm\n0.1 (as per the listed papers)\nPrevents gradients from getting too large during training. This will help to ensure stable training. See more at paperswithcode.com/method/gradient-clipping.\n\n\nnum_train_epochs\n25 (depends on training data and available time)\nDefines how many laps of the data your model will do. For example, setting epochs to 25 means the model will do 25 laps of the training data to learn different patterns. In practice, I’ve found this value to be a good starting point for our dataset and also because we are fine-tuning rather than training from scratch. However, if you had more data you might want to do more epochs (when training from scratch, the papers did 300 epochs).\n\n\nwarmup_ratio\n0.05\nPercentage of total training steps to take learning rate from 0 to to the set value (e.g. 0.0001). Can help with training stability in the early training steps of the model by not doing too large updates when first starting out. The papers state 2000 warmup steps, however, in practice I found this to be too many for our smaller dataset.\n\n\ndataloader_num_workers\n4 (hardware dependent)\nNumber of workers to load data from the CPU to the GPU. Higher is generally better if it is available, however, it can often cap out. Experimentally I’ve found that 0.5 * os.cpu_count() generally works well.\n\n\n\nTK image - showcase different papers referencing the hyperparameters for the models\nIt’s important to note that all of these values can be experimented with.\nAnd just because a research paper mentions a specific value, doesn’t mean you have to use.\nFor example, all the mentioned research papers tend to focus on training a model from scratch on the COCO dataset (330k images, 80 classes).\nWhich is a much larger dataset with more classes than our dataset (1k images, 7 classes) which we are trying to fine-tune an existing model on rather than train from scratch.\nThere are many more possible arguments/settings we’ve left out in the above table but if you’d like to explore these, I’d encourage you to check out the documentation for transformers.TrainingArguments.\n\n# 3.

Optional: Setting up an optimizer for multiple learning rates\nIn the papers that mentioned the DETR model we’re using (see Table 1 in the RT-DETRv2 paper), they state that they used a different learning rate value for the backbone (learning_rate=1e-5) as well as the object detection head (learning_rate=1e-4).\nTo set this up ourselves, we can extract which parameters of our model belong to the backbone as well as which don’t.\nTo find the backbone parameters, we can loop through our model’s named_parameters() method and filter for any which contain the string \"backbone\" in their name.\nWe’ll append these to a list called backbone_parameters and assume any that don’t have \"backbone\" in their name are not part of the model’s backbone.\nWe can use these two lists of parameters to pass to torch.optim.AdamW with different learning rate values for each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn my experiments with our smaller dataset size (~1100 images), I found that setting two different learning rates for the backbone and the object detection head led to poorer performance than just setting a single learning rate for the whole model.\nThe code below is an example of how to create a custom optimizer with different learning rates for different parts of the model.\nHowever, in our actual training code, we’ll use a single learning rate for the whole model.\n\n\nWe can then subclass transformers.Trainer and update the method create_optimizer() to use our custom optimizer.\n\nfrom transformers import Trainer\n\n# Create lists for different kinds of parameters\nbackbone_parameters = []\nother_parameters = []\n\n# Can loop through model parameters and extract different model sections\nfor name, param in model.model.named_parameters(): \n    if \"backbone\" in name:\n        # print(f\"Backbone parameter: {name}\")\n        backbone_parameters.append(param)\n    else:\n        # print(f\"Other parameter: {name}\")\n        other_parameters.append(param)\n\nprint(f\"[INFO] Number of backbone parameter modules: {len(backbone_parameters)}\")\nprint(f\"[INFO] Number of other parameter modules: {len(other_parameters)}\")\n\n# Setup a custom subclass of Trainer to use different learning rates for different parts of the model\nclass CustomTrainer(Trainer):\n    def create_optimizer(self):\n        self.optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW([\n            {\"params\": backbone_parameters, \"lr\": 1e-4},\n            {\"params\": other_parameters, \"lr\": 1e-4}\n        ], weight_decay=0.0001)\n        return self.optimizer\n\n[INFO] Number of backbone parameter modules: 55\n[INFO] Number of other parameter modules: 363\n\n\nAwesome!\nNow if we wanted to use our custom optimizer, we could use CustomTrainer instead of Trainer.\n\n\n14.3 TK - Creating an evaluation function\nEvaluating a model’s performance is just as important as training a model.\nAfter all, if you don’t know how well your model is performing, how can you be confident in deploying it or using it in the real world?\nIn this section, let’s create an evaluation function we can pass to transformers.Trainer’s compute_metrics parameter.\nThe main goal of an evaluation function is to compare the model’s predictions to the ground truth labels.\nFor example, how does a model’s box predictions look like compared to the ground truth box predictions?\nOnce we’ve got a trained model, we can inspect these visually by plotting them on images.\nHowever, during model training, we’ll get our Trainer instance to output evaluation metrics so we can get a snapshot of performance along the way.\nSome things to note about the evaluation function we’ll create:\n\nReading the documentation for the compute_metrics parameter, we can see our evaluation function will be required to take a transformers.EvalPrediction as input.\n\nThis contains our model’s predictions and labels as predictions and label_ids attributes respectively.\n\nWe must also return a dictionary with string to metric values for it to be displayed during training. For example, {\"metric_value\": 42, ...}.\nTo evaluate our object detection model we’re going to use the mAP metric (Mean Average Precision, a standard metric used amongst object detection models, see the COCO evaluation section for more details). To do so, we’ll use torchmetrics package, specifically torchmetrics.detection.mean_ap.MeanAveragePrecision.\n\nThis method expects boxes in format XYXY absolute format by default.\n\nOur evaluation function will be an adaptation of the code example in the object detection example on the Hugging Face GitHub.\nFor an in-depth overview on object detection metrics, see the Roboflow Guide to Object Detection Metrics.\n\nPhew! A fair bit to take in.\nBut nothing we can’t handle.\nLet’s create our function.\nWe’ll start by making a small helper function to convert bounding boxes from CXCYWH normalized format to XYXY absolute format.\n\ndef convert_bbox_cxcywh_to_xyxy_absolute(boxes, image_size_target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts CXCYWH normalized boxes to XYXY absolute boxes.\n\n    The output of our preprocess method puts boxes in CXCYWH format.\n\n    But our evaluation metric torchmetrics.detection.mean_ap.MeanAveragePrecision expects\n        boxes in XYXY absolute format.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert normalized CXCYWH (output of model) -&gt; absolute XYXY format (required for evaluation)\n    boxes = box_convert(boxes=boxes, in_fmt=\"cxcywh\", out_fmt=\"xyxy\")\n\n    # Convert normalized box coordinates to absolute pixel values based on the target size \n    image_size_target_height = image_size_target[0]\n    image_size_target_width = image_size_target[1]\n    boxes = boxes * torch.tensor([image_size_target_width, \n                                  image_size_target_height, \n                                  image_size_target_width, \n                                  image_size_target_height]) # Multiply X coordinates by the width and Y coordinates by the height\n\n    return boxes\n\nPerfect!\nTime to craft our compute_metrics function.\nThe main goal of the function will be to take a transformers.EvalPrediction output from our model and return a dictionary mapping metric names to values, for example, {\"metric_name\": 42.0 ...}.\nTo do so, we’ll go through the following steps:\n\nCreate a Python dataclass to hold our model’s outputs. We could use a dictionary but this will give our code a bit more structure.\nCreate a compute_metrics function which takes in an EvalPrediction object as well as other required evaluation parameters such as image_processor (for post processing boxes), id2label (for mapping metrics to class names) and threshold (for assigning a prediction probability threshold to boxes).\nExtract predictions and targets from EvalPrediction via EvalPrediction.predictions and EvalPrediction.label_ids respectively.\nCreate empty lists of image_sizes (for post processing boxes), post_processed_predictions and post_processed_targets (we’ll compare the latter two to each other).\nCollect target samples in format required for torchmetrics.detection.mean_ap.MeanAveragePrecision, for example, [{\"boxes\": [...], \"labels\": [...]}].\nCollect predictions in the required formart for MeanAveragePrecision, our model produces boxes in CXCYWH format, then we use image_processor.post_process_object_detection to convert the predictions to XYXY format, and append them to post_processed_predictions in form [{\"boxes\": [...], \"labels\": [...], \"scores\": [...]}].\nInitialize an instance of torchmetrics.detection.mean_ap.MeanAveragePrecision (see documentation for output of MeanAveragePrecision) and pass it predictions and labels to compute on.\nExtract lists of target metrics from the output of MeanAveragePrecision, for example, with metrics.pop(\"target_item\").\nPrepare metrics for output in the form of a dict with metric names -&gt; values, for example, {\"metric_name\": 42.0, ...}.\nRound metric values in output dictionary for visual display during training.\nCreate a partial function we can pass to transformers.Trainer’s compute_metrics parameter to run as a callable with appropriate parameter inputs to our compute_metrics function.\n\nEasy.\nWe’ve got this.\n\n# Create an evaluation function to test our model's performance\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom typing import Optional, Mapping\n\nfrom transformers import EvalPrediction\n\nfrom torchvision.ops import box_convert\n\nfrom torchmetrics.detection.mean_ap import MeanAveragePrecision\n\n# 1.

    "text": "Glossary\nThis is messy and a work in progress. Will tidy up later.\n\nPredictive vs generative AI = predictive AI -&gt; machine readable outputs, generative AI -&gt; human readable outputs. Predictive style models take in data and map it to a fixed output space (e.g. a text classification model predicting whether an email is spam or not). Generative AI models take in data and generate an unbounded response (though theorectically this response is bounded by the training distribution), such as, a chat system taking in natural language instructions and producing natural language as output. Generative AI models can be turned into predictive-style models, for example a generative LLM could produce JSON outputs if instructed/constrained to do so.\nTransformer = A deep learning model that adopts the attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output\nTokenization = turning a series of data (text or image) into a series of tokens, where a token is a numerical representation of the input data, for example, in the case of text, tokenization could mean turning the words in a sentence into numbers (e.g. “hello world” -&gt; [101, 102])\nTokens = a token is a letter, word or word-piece (word) that a model uses to represent input data, for example, in the case of text, a token could be a word (e.g. “hello”) or a word-piece (e.g. “hell” and “o”), see: https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer for an example\ntransformers = A Python library by Hugging Face that provides a wide range of pre-trained transformer models, fine-tuning tools, and utilities to use them\ndatasets = A Python library by Hugging Face that provides a wide range of datasets for NLP and CV tasks\ntokenizers = A Python library by Hugging Face that provides a wide range of tokenizers for NLP tasks\nevaluate = A Python library by Hugging Face with premade evaluation functions for various tasks\ntorch = PyTorch, an open-source machine learning library\ntransformers.pipeline = an abstraction to get a machine learning pipeline up and running in a few lines of code, handles data preprocessing and device placement behind the scences. For example, transformers.pipeline(\"text-classification\") can be used to tokenize input text and classify it.\ntransfer learning = taking what one model has learned and applying it to another task (e.g. a model which has learned across many millions of words of text from the internet and then adjusting it to work with your smaller dataset)\nfine-tuning = a type of transfer learning where you take the existing patterns of one model (usually trained on a very large dataset) and customize them to work for your smaller dataset\nfull fine-tuning = fine-tune all of a models parameters to your dataset\npartial fine-tuning = only fine-tune a portion of a models parameters to your dataset\nfeature extraction fine-tuning = only fine-tune the final layer(s) of model to your dataset (e.g. the majority of the backbone stays frozen)\nLoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) = train an adaptor matrix (far fewer parameters than a full model) to apply to your base model weights (base model weights stay frozen)\nhyperparameters = values you can set to adjust training settings, for example, learning rate is a hyperparameter that is adjustable\nHugging Face Hub (or Hub for short) = Place to store datasets, models, and other resources of your own + find existing datasets, models & scripts others have shared. If you are familiar with GitHub, Hugging Face is like the GitHub of machine learning.\nAuto Classes = A series of classes in transformers which enables automatic loading of preprocessor or model classes based on the name or path of the model. For example you can load the processor for microsoft/conditional-detr-resnet-50 with transformers.AutoImageProcessor(microsoft/conditional-detr-resnet-50) or the model architecture with transformers.AutoModelForObjectDetection(microsoft/conditional-detr-resnet-50).\nHugging Face Spaces = A platform to share and run machine learning apps/demos, these can be built with HTML, Gradio or Streamlit\nHF = Hugging Face\nNLP = Natural Language Processing\nCV = Computer Vision\nImage classification = Classify an image in a single or multiple classes (classifying something as multiple items or labels such as [warm, well lit, sunset] is also known as tagging or more specifically, image tagging), for example, is a photo of food or not food.\nObject detection = Detect and locate an item in an image or series of images (e.g. a video). An item can be almost anything in an image, for example, a licence plate, a person, a weed in a garden or a small bug on the body of a bee.\nBounding box = A box, often rectangular in nature, drawn around an item in an image to indicate its location. Can come in several different forms such as XYXY, XYWH and CXCYWH (see more in A Guide to Bounding Box Formats and How to Draw Them).\nTPU = Tensor Processing Unit\nGPU = Graphics Processing Unit\nLearning rate = Often the most important hyperparameter to tune. It is proportional with the amount an optimizer will update a model’s parameters every update step. A higher amount means larger updates (though sometimes too large) a lower amount means smaller updates (though sometimes not enough). The most ideal learning rate is experimental. Common values include 0.001, 0.0001, 0.0005, 0.00001, 0.00005 (though the learning rate can be any value). Many optimizers have decent default learning rates. For example, the Adam optimizer (a common and generally well performing optimizer) in PyTorch (torch.optim.Adam) has a default learning rate of 0.001. For fine-tuning an already trained model a learning rate of 10x smaller than the default is a good rule of thumb (e.g. if a model was trained with a learning rate of 0.001, fine-tuning with 0.0001 is common). The learning rate does not have to be static and can change dynamcially during training, this practice is referred to as learning rate scheduling.\nInference = using a trained (or untrained) model to make predictions on a given piece of data. The model infers what the output should be based on the inputs. Inference is often much faster than training on a sample per sample basis because no weights get updated during inference. Though, when compared to training, inference can often take more compute in the long run. Because a model can be trained once but then used for inference millions of times (or more) over the next several months (or longer).\nPrediction probability = the probability of a model’s prediction for a given input, is a score between 0 and 1 with 1 being the highest, for example, a model may have a prediction probability of 0.95, this would mean it’s quite confident with its prediction but it doesn’t mean it’s correct. A good way to inspect potential issues with a dataset is to show examples in the test set which have a high prediction probability but are wrong (e.g. pred prob = 0.98 but the prediction was incorrect).\nHugging Face Pipeline (pipeline) = A high-level API for using model for various tasks (e.g. text-classification, audio-classification, image-classification, object-detection and more), see the docs: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.41.3/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline\nloss value = Measure of how wrong your model is by a given metric. A perfect model will have a loss value of 0 (it is able to predict the data perfectly), though this is highly unlikely in practice (there are no perfect models). Ideally, the loss value will go down (towards 0) as training goes on. If the loss value on the training set is lower than the loss value on the test set, the model is likely overfitting (memorizing the training set too well rather than learning generalizable patterns to unseen data). To fix overfitting, introduce more regularization. To fix underfitting (loss not going down), introduce more learning capacity (more data, more parameters in the model, longer training). Machine learning is a constant battle between overfitting and underfitting.\nRandom seed = Value to flavour the randomness of an operation. For example, if you set a random seed to 42 the numbers produced by a random generator will be random but flavoured by the seed. This means if the seed stays at 42, subsequent calls of the same operation will return the same values. Not setting a random seed will result in different random values each time. Setting a random seed is done to ensure reproducibility of an operation. This is helpful when performing experiments and you do not want the outputs to be random each time.\nSynthetic data generation = using a model such as a generative Large Language Model (LLM) to generate synthetic pieces of data for a specific problem. For example, getting an LLM to generate food and not food image captions to create a binary text classification model. Synthetic data is very helpful when bootstrapping a machine learning problem. Though it is advised to only train on synthetic data and to evaluate on real data whenever possible.\nPre-trained models = models which have already been trained on a large dataset, for example, text-based models which have gone through many millions of words of text (e.g. all of Wikipedia and 1000s of books) or image-based models which have seen millions of images (e.g. models trained on ImageNet). In essence, any model which has already spent a large amount of time learning patterns in data. These patterns can then be adjusted for your own sample problems, often with much much smaller amounts of data for excellent results. The process of customizing a pre-trained model for a specific problem is called transfer learning (transferring what an existing model knows to your own problem).\nTraining/test split = One of the most important concepts in machine learning. Train models on the training data and evaluate them on the test data. The test data should never be seen by a model during training. Think of the test data as the final exam in a university course. A model should be able to learn enough patterns in the training set to perform well on the test set. Just like a student should be able to learn enough on course materials to do well on the final exam. If a model performs well on the training set but not well on the test set, this is known as overfitting, as in, the model memorizes the training set rather than learning generalizable patterns to unseen data. If a model performs poorly on both the training set and the test set, this is known as underfitting.\n\nPrediction probabilities = a value assigned to a model’s prediction on a certain sample after its output logits have passed through an activation function such as Softmax or Sigmoid. For example, in a binary classification problem of whether an image is of food or not of food, a model could assign a prediction probability of the image being 0.98 food and 0.02 not food. Prediction probabilities do not indicate how right a prediction is, more so, how confident a model is in that prediction. The closer a prediction probability to 1, the higher the model’s confidence in the prediction. A good evaluation step is to inspect samples with low prediction probabilities (the model seems to get confused on them) or inspect test samples where the model has a high prediction probability but the prediction is wrong (these predictions are often referred to as most wrong predictions).\nTK - logits - the raw outputs of a model\nTK - Softmax function - an activation function which can be applied to logits to get prediction probabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
