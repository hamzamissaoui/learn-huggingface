    "Why fine-tune?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we want small model for a specific task (e.g. don't to pay API credits or leak our data online).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have our own model... we can run it anywhere and everywhere we like.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to fine-tune an LLM model\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to do Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT). \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically SFT = give samples of inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if our goal was to extract names: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: Hello my name is Daniel\n",
    "- Output: Daniel\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our inputs can be *any* kind of input string.\n",
    "* Our outputs will be fine-tuned to conform to a structured data pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we're cooking\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to build a SLM (Small Language Model) to extract food and drink items from text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we needed to go over a large dataset of image captions and filter them for food items (we could then use these filtered captions for a food app).\n",
    "\n",
    "TK image - example of what we're doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ingredients\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model (Gemma3-270M)\n",
    "2. Dataset (a pre-baked dataset to extract foods from text)\n",
    "3. Training code (Hugging Face Transformers + TRL)\n",
    "4. Eval code\n",
    "5. Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download model - Hugging Face `transformers`\n",
    "2. Download dataset - Hugging Face `datasets`\n",
    "3. Inspect dataset - Hugging Face `datasets` \n",
    "4. Train model on dataset - Hugging Face `trl` (TRL = Transformers Reinforcement Learning)\n",
    "5. Eval model - basically just look at a bunch of samples\n",
    "6. Create an interactive demo - Hugging Face `gradio` \n",
    "7. Bonus: Make the demo public so other people can use it - Hugging Face Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fine-tuning LLM vs RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fine-tuning = To do a very specific task, e.g. structured data extraction.\n",
    "    * An example would be you're an insurance company who gets 10,000 emails a day and you want to extract structured data directly from these emails to JSON.\n",
    "* RAG = You want to inject custom knowledge into an LLM.\n",
    "    * An example would be you're an insurance company wanting to send *automatic* responses to people but you want the responses to include information from your own docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why fine-tune your own model?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Own the model, can run on own hardware\n",
    "2. Our task is simple enough to just use a small language model\n",
    "3. No API calls needed \n",
    "4. Can run in batch mode to get much faster inference than API calls\n",
    "5. Model by default wasn't very good at our task but now since fine-tuning, is *very good* \n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "* TK - Some definitions of what we're doing\n",
    "* Full fine-tuning\n",
    "* LORA fine-tuning (this is partial fine-tuning)\n",
    "* SLM"
